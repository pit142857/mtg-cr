Acknowledgements and Disclaimers
A - Abilities
A.1 - General Rulings on Abilities
A.1.1 - An "ability" is any capability of the card described in the card's text area. For token permanents, any abilities are described in the spell or ability which created the token (see Rule K.25). The result of an ability is called its "effect". Note that the text describing the effects of a spell (see Rule K.3) that is not going to be a permanent are not considered abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.1.2 - A permanent may have the same ability more than once. For activated abilities (see Rule A.2), only one can be used at a time. For triggered abilities (see Rule A.8), all of them trigger. For continuous abilities (see Rule A.4), they may or may not be cumulative. [Mirage, Page 29]
A.1.3 - Any effect which removes an ability removes all instances of that ability. For example, if a creature had Flanking twice, then removing Flanking would remove both instances of the ability. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.1.4 - Abilities of a card do not apply when the card is not in play, unless explicitly stated otherwise. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.1.5 - Abilities played when a card is not in play are not "creature abilities", "artifact abilities", or so on. They are "card abilities" (or more specifically "creature card abilities", etc.). Thus, things which affect creature abilities do not affect the abilities of cards which are not in play. For example, Ashen Ghoul is not affected by Cursed Totem. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]
A.1.6 - Unless otherwise stated, the controller of the permanent generating the ability is the only one who can play it. [bethmo 02/21/97] Exceptions are usually noted with text such as "any/each player may". [D'Angelo 08/03/98]
A.1.7 - If a card says "During such-and-such player's upkeep, do something", the ability is played by the current player. It does not matter who controls the permanent generating the ability. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97] Such abilities are controlled by the controller of the permanent, even though that may be different from the player who played the ability. See Rule A.5.4. [DeLaney 08/20/98]
A.1.8 - If a card says "all players", "each player" or "any player may" do something, then the ability is played by that player and not by the card's controller. [bethmo 02/21/97] For example, Howling Mine makes each player play the drawing ability during their draw phase. Also see Rule A.5.7, Rule A.8.11, and Rule A.8.12.
A.1.9 - If an ability does not specify who plays it or specifies "you", then it is only played by the controller of the permanent. [bethmo 02/21/97] See Rule A.1.6.
A.1.10 - The characteristics (see Rule K.4) and controller of an ability are "locked in" when the ability is announced. The characteristics are the same as the characteristics of the source at that time. [Mirage, Page 26] See Rule K.4.4.
A.1.11 - Abilities can only affect permanents in play and players unless otherwise stated.
A.1.12 - An effect is considered to grant an ability if it says that a permanent "gains <-something->" or "gets <-something->", where the <-something> is anything other than a power/toughness bonus (such as +1/+1). The effect is just an effect if these words are not present. For example, Flight grants an ability, while Pacifism just has an effect. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
A.1.13 - The player playing an ability makes all choices, and they use that player as their reference. This player may be different from the controller of the permanent (which can happen with phase abilities, see Rule A.5.4). For example, Oath of Scholars says "During each player's upkeep, if that player has fewer cards in hand than target opponent, the player may discard his or her hand and draw three cards." The word "opponent" is interpreted as "opponent of the player of this ability", not the "opponent of the controller of Oath of Scholars". [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98]
A.1.14 - An ability is considered "a mana-producing ability" if it can produce mana under some set of conditions, even if those conditions are not currently being met. For example, Gaea's Cradle has a mana-producing ability even if you have no creatures. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] Also, any colors or types of mana the ability can produce under some set of conditions are considered by effects which check what the ability can generate. It does not matter if those conditions are currently being met. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
A.1.15 - An effect that copies or depends on the type of mana a card's abilities can produce checks all normal effects (such as Phantasmal Terrain changing a land's type) and replacement effects (such as Contamination), but does not check additional mana that might be generated due to triggered abilities (such as Wild Growth or Fertile Ground). [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
A.1.16 - If a mana copying effect or triggered ability generates mana and there is a choice of what type involved, the player playing the mana-producing ability decides the color, regardless of who controls any of these effects. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] For example, if an opponent places Fertile Ground on one of your lands, you decide the color of mana it generates.
A.1.17 - Abilities that trigger (see Rule A.8) when a land is tapped for mana (such as Wild Growth and Mana Flare) trigger even if the land produces no mana. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
Note - The text "Counts as a <-something->" is not an ability. See Rule G.10.2.
Note - Destroying the source of the ability after the announcement will not affect the ability at all. See Rule K.4.4. For example, destroying a Prodigal Sorcerer after its ability has been announced will not prevent or modify the ability.
Note - Playing an ability is not considered as "casting a spell". Spells are different. See Rule K.3 .
A.2 - Activated Abilities
A.2.1 - Activated abilities are written as "<-cost->: <-effect->". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.2 - The cost is paid when the ability is announced (see Rule T.4). The effect happens when the ability resolves (see Rule T.7). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.3 - Activated abilities are played as an Instant (and are Instants for all reasons) unless otherwise stated (or implied by context to be a triggered ability or some other kind of ability). There is one exception. The ability of lands to tap for mana is not stated as being played as a Mana Source, but it still is. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.4 - Activated abilities may only be used while the permanent is in play unless otherwise stated. See Rule A.1.4 [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.5 - An ability may have an effect which is done once (such as doing damage to a creature), it may have a duration (such as "until end of turn" or "as long as <-something is true->"), or it may create some other activated, continuous, or triggered ability for future use. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.6 - A restriction like "No more than XX can be spent each turn" applies to all players who might control the card during a turn. A restriction like "Use this only X times" or "You may pay no more than X" applies to each player separately, because it implies the controller is the one being limited. [Aahz 03/17/97]
A.2.Ruling.1 - Each use of an ability is separate. You cannot pay the cost multiple times in a single use. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 26] For example, you cannot pay BB to have Pestilence do 2 points of damage. You can pay B twice to have Pestilence do 1 damage two separate times.
A.2.Ruling.2 - A restriction like "No more than 4 can be spent this way each turn" effectively limits the number of uses, but if the use cost changes the number of limited uses may change. For example, a Roterothopter with Power Artifact can be given +4/+0 because this can be done with four payments of 1 mana. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]
A.2.Ruling.3 - Effects that increase the cost to use an activated ability apply to each activation. For example, if Gloom was in play and Holy Armor was used 5 times, you would have to pay 20 mana (5*(1+3)) for the +0/+5 bonus. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.2.Ruling.4 - Triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) which are activated are played as trigggered abilities and not as instants (see Rule A.2.3). And they trigger only while in play, rather than being played only while they are in play (see Rule A.2.4). [D'Angelo 08/25/98]
Note - This same format is used on instants, sorceries, and mana sources to indicate part of the play cost (see Rule K.21.3). Something is an activated ability only if it appears on cards which can become permanents. [D'Angelo 05/28/98]
Note - Activated abilities that include "use this ability only when <-something happens->" are played as triggered abilities. See Rule A.8.2.
A.3 - Begin/End of Phase Abilities
A.3.1 - Begin/end of phase abilities are written as "At the end of <-phase->, do <-something->." Playing the ability is mandatory unless it says "you may do <-something->". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.3.2 - These abilities are played during the Series (see Rule T.9) at the beginning or end of the appropriate phase (or turn). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.3.3 - A begin/end of phase ability which requires a target cannot be played if there is no legal target. Unless stated otherwise, there is no penalty for not playing the ability. [D'Angelo 09/25/96]
A.3.4 - If a new beginning or end of phase ability is introduced which affects a player while dealing with that player's beginning or end of phase Series (see Rule T.9), you have to deal with the new ability as well. But, once you pass a player's phase abilities and go to the next player, you do not loop back and do the previous player's abilities again (see Rule T.9.1).
A.3.5 - Begin/end of phase abilities are played only once each turn. [Barclay 08/03/98]
A.4 - Continuous Abilities
A.4.1 - Continuous abilities have no cost to activate and are always in effect while the permanent is in play. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.4.2 - Some continuous abilities may have conditional clauses such as "<-something happens-> as long as <-some condition is true->" or "As long as <-something is true->, <-something happens->".
A.4.Ruling.1 - Continuous abilities only affect things in play unless otherwise stated. See Rule A.1.11. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - See Rule T.2 and Rule T.14 for information on the effects of continuous abilities.
Note - Continuous abilities of non-creature, non-land artifacts are "turned off" if the card is tapped. Creatures and lands are not subject to this rule. See Rule K.6.4 and Rule K.6.5.
A.5 - Phase Abilities
Note - Phase abilities are worded very similarly to Phase Costs (see Rule A.6), so make sure you find the appropriate entry.
A.5.1 - Phase abilities are written as "During <-phase->, do <-something->." Playing the ability is mandatory unless it says "you may do <-something->." [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.5.2 - Phase abilities are played exactly once during the appropriate phase. They may not be played more than once. [Fifth Edition, Page 47]
A.5.3 - These abilities are played as an Instant. Any targets are chosen and choices are made on announcing (see Rule T.4) the <-something-> happens on resolution (see Rule T.7). [Fifth Edition, Page 47] See Rule T.1.5.
A.5.4 - Phase abilities are played by the active player, but are controlled by the controller of the source of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98] For example, when Bottomless Pit is in play, the current player plays the ability when they want to, but the opponent may be considered the controller of the discard, and thereby trigger Guerrilla Tactics.
A.5.5 - A phase ability which requires a target cannot be played if there is no legal target. Unless stated otherwise, there is no penalty for not playing the ability. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.5.6 - If a phase ability for a permanent is dealt with, and then the permanent stops being and then returns to being affected by the phase ability, the permanent does not gain a new, un-dealt-with phase ability. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] For example, if a creature phases out and back in during the same upkeep, you do not do the phase ability again.
A.5.7 - If a player is instructed to play a phase ability of a permanent they do not control, the controller of the permanent is still considered to be the controller of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 05/02/98] For example, Bottomless Pit. See Rule G.6.Ruling.2.
A.5.Ruling.1 - All parts of a phase ability are done on resolution. This is true even if you might normally consider what is being done as being a cost. For example, "During your upkeep, sacrifice a land" has you choose a land on resolution and sacrifice it, and "During your upkeep, pay 1" has you pay 1 mana during resolution of the phase effect. [Aahz 09/15/97]
A.5.Ruling.2 - Most phase abilities are imparted by a permanent. You can avoid dealing with the phase ability by removing the permanent from play or by otherwise deactivating its effect (remember that non-creature, non-land artifacts deactivate when they are in a tapped state). [Fifth Edition, Page 48] For example, if you Disenchant an Unstable Mutation off a creature, you do not later need to put the -1/-1 counter on it. If you already dealt with the effect prior to removing the permanent from play, however, this does not undo the effect.
A.5.Ruling.3 - A phase ability worded as "During <-phase->, if <-something is true->, do <-something->." is a mandatory ability. The check to see if the something is true is done on resolution of the ability. [bethmo 10/23/97]
A.5.Ruling.4 - If a phase ability fizzles with respect to all of its targets, it is considered dealt with and may not be played again. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 25]
A.5.Ruling.5 - Abilities written as "<-cost->: <-effect->. Use this ability only during <-phase->" are not phase abilities. They are simply activated abilities (see Rule A.2) which have a restriction on when they can be played. [Aahz 10/16/96]
Note - A player cannot decline to start a Batch (see Rule T.8) if they have a mandatory phase ability which has not been played, and which can be played. [Fifth Edition, Page 47] For example, Erhnam Djinn says to give an opponent's creature Forestwalk during Upkeep. You cannot end upkeep without dealing with this if there are any valid target creatures in play, but if there are no valid target creatures, you may do so.
Note - Having a phase ability applied to a permanent does not prevent the abilities of the permanent from being used. Only phase costs (see Rule A.6) do that.
Note - Untap costs (see Rule A.10) are different from phase abilities, so the phase ability rules do not apply to them.
A.6 - Phase Cost
A.6.1 - Phase costs are written "During <-phase->, do <-cost-> or else <-something happens->", or as "During <-phase->, do <-cost->. If you cannot, then <-something happens->". The <-cost-> is usually a sacrifice, payment of mana, or payment of life, but it can be anything. [Aahz 09/15/97]
A.6.2 - A phase cost is mandatory if it says you must pay using the first wording in Rule A.6.1. It is not mandatory if the first wording in A.6.1 does not use the word "must". A phase cost is always mandatory if you are using the second wording in Rule A.6.1. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.6.3 - All phase costs on a permanent are cumulative into a single cost which must either be paid all at once or not at all. [Fifth Edition, Page 48]
A.6.4 - If there are multiple phase costs with different times that they can be paid, then the entire cost can only be paid when the latest of the costs can be paid. For example, if one cost is paid during upkeep and another is paid at the end of upkeep, then the cost is paid at the end of upkeep. [Fifth Edition, Page 49]
A.6.5 - If there are multiple phase costs and any one of them is mandatory, then the entire cost is mandatory. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97] [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 30] For example, a Lord of the Pit is in play with The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, then you must sacrifice a creature and pay 1 mana (if possible).
A.6.6 - When played during a phase, it is played as an Instant with the <-cost-> being paid (or not being paid) on announcing (see Rule T.4), and either nothing happening (if the cost was paid) or the <-something happens-> happening (if the cost was not paid) on resolution (see Rule T.7). The phase cost is not considered "dealt with" until the resolution is complete. See Rule T.1.5. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.6.7 - When a phase cost is to be paid at the beginning or end of a phase, play it as a beginning/end of phase ability (see Rule A.3) with the same announce and resolution aspect as in Rule A.6.6. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.6.8 - The phase cost must be paid (or not paid) exactly once per turn. [Mirage, Page 43]
A.6.9 - Permanents with phase costs on them may not use any activated abilities (see Rule A.2) during a turn until the phase cost has been "dealt with" for that turn. [Fifth Edition, Page 49] This means if the phase cost is paid during upkeep, the ability cannot be used during untap because that would be prior to the cost being paid.
A.6.10 - If there are multiple phase costs on a single permanent, the <-something happens-> part is played out as a sequence of effects rather than as a single effect. First the permanent's own phase cost penalty, then the others in the order in which the phase cost entered play. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97] [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 30] The timing is the same as if resolving a single ability (see Rule T.7.1) with each of the effects being an "event".
A.6.11 - Phase costs are played by the active player, but are controlled by the controller of the source of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98]
A.6.12 - If a phase cost for a permanent is dealt with, and then the permanent stops being and then returns to being affected by the phase cost, the permanent does not gain a new, unpaid phase cost. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] For example, if a creature phases out and back in during the same upkeep, you do not pay the phase cost again. Similarly, if an artifact de-animates and then re-animates, any phase cost applied to creatures would not have to be re-paid.
A.6.13 - If phase costs combine in a way that makes them contradictory, then you cannot pay any of the costs and the side-effects of not paying take place as normal. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] For example, if you had to both sacrifice a card and send that same card to your hand as part of the phase cost of a single permanent, you could not do either.
A.6.Ruling.1 - Continuous and non-optional abilities are not prevented by phase costs. See Rule A.6.9.
A.6.Ruling.2 - If you choose not to pay the phase cost, the optional abilities may not be used until after the negative results are applied (see Rule A.6.6). [D'Angelo 02/03/98] Note that a destroyed or buried permanent is put in the graveyard during resolution, so there is no time to use it afterwards.
A.6.Ruling.3 - Most phase costs are imparted by a permanent. You can avoid dealing with the phase cost by removing the permanent from play. [Fifth Edition, Page 49]
A.6.Ruling.4 - If something happens which adds a phase cost during a phase, it must be paid. For example, if a Vesuvan Doppelganger becomes a Lord of the Pit, during upkeep, a creature must be sacrificed if possible. [Fifth Edition, Page 49]
A.6.Ruling.5 - If the phase cost for a permanent is paid and then the nature of the cost is changed with something like Sleight of Mind, you do not have to repay the cost. The permanent knows that the cost has already been paid. [Aahz 07/22/97]
A.6.Ruling.6 - If a phase cost is mandatory, you do not need to do anything special to make it possible to pay. So, if a phase cost says you must sacrifice a creature and you have no creatures, you are not required to use your The Hive to generate a creature. Similarly, you are not required to draw mana from any mana sources in order to pay a phase cost (unless the ability says otherwise). [Aahz 08/20/96]
Note - The most common phase to have phase cost in is the Upkeep phase (see Rule P.6), and they are commonly called Upkeep Costs.
Note - Phase costs are not turned off when a non-creature, not-land artifact is tapped. See Rule K.6.4.
Note - Untap costs (see Rule A.10) are different from phase costs, so the phase cost rules do not apply to them.
A.7 - Replacement Abilities
A.7.1 - A replacement ability is an ability which replaces part of the effect of the resolution of another spell or ability with a different effect. They are usually worded using the word "instead" to indicate that something is replaced. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.7.2 - Replacement abilities are played in a Series (see Rule T.9) just prior to that part/event of the spell or ability which they are altering. [Fifth Edition, Page 46] See Rule T.7.1 for the exact timing.
A.7.3 - If a single effect is modified by a replacement ability so that the effect gives contradictory instructions, such as "put this card in the graveyard and in your hand", then all contradictory parts of the effect are ignored. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
A.7.4 - Replacement abilities are not played for any costs paid when announcing a spell or ability, or for the effects of a mana source. [D'Angelo 11/03/98]
A.7.5 - A few cards have "continuous replacement" abilities. These are not played in a Series and can modify costs and mana sources. If two or more continuous replacements try to modify the same event, the active player chooses the order in which to apply the ones they control, then the other player chooses to apply the ones they control. [WotC Rules Team 11/02/98] These cards are not marked by explicit text. They are usually easy to notice since they modify mana production or such, but in some cases this is just explicitly noted for various cards. Some cards included in this ruling are Contamination, Furnace of Rath, Hall of Gemstone, Infernal Darkness, Naked Singularity, Ritual of Subdual, Serra Avatar, Sulfuric Vapors, and Yawgmoth's Will. It does not include cards like Wild Growth and Mana Flare.
A.7.Ruling.1 - Regeneration (see Rule G.32) is a replacement ability, so it is played just prior to any effect resolving which would destroy a creature. [Mirage, Page 40]
A.7.Ruling.2 - Jandor's Ring and Aladdin's Lamp are used as replacement abilities to modify the resolution of a draw effect. [Aahz 11/30/95]
A.7.Ruling.3 - An exchange is considered two separate control changes or card moves for purposes of replacement abilities. For example, if an effect has you exchange a card in play for one in the graveyard, it would be replacable as if it were putting the one card into the graveyard separately from the bringing of the other card into play. [bethmo 02/11/99]
Note - When a replacement ability is used, it changes the upcoming effect and therefore causes a new Series (see Rule T.9) of replacement abilities to be started. See Rule T.9.5.
Note - Look under specific card entries for details on how specific replacement abilities work.
A.8 - Triggered Abilities
A.8.1 - Triggered abilities are written as "If <-something happens->, do <-something->" or "When/whenever <-something happens->, do <-something->" or "For each <-something that happens->, do <-something->". If the ability says you "may do <-something->", then use of the ability is optional. If not, then use of the ability is mandatory. [D'Angelo 08/03/98]
A.8.2 - Triggered abilities can have activation costs (see Rule A.2). In this case, they are written as "<-cost->: <-effect->. Use this ability only when <-something happens->". The ability can only be used one time per trigger condition. This is usually noted on the card as a reminder. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.8.3 - Triggered abilities check their condition continuously, even during the middle of an event (see Rule T.1.9), but they are played only after the event (see Rule T.1.9) or transition in the game (such as a spell becoming "successfully cast) completes. See Rule T.5, Rule T.6, and Rule T.7 for when triggered abilities are played.
A.8.4 - Triggered abilities only trigger while the permanent is in play unless otherwise stated. See Rule A.1.4. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.8.5 - All the characteristics of a triggered ability are locked in when that ability triggers. The characteristics are the same as the characteristics of the source at that time. This may be a while before the ability is actually played/announced during the Series (see Rule T.9) for triggered abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98] If the ability checks the characteristics of something in play, including its source, it checks those characteristics during resolution. See Rule K.4.4, Rule K.4.5 and Rule K.4.6 for additional details.
A.8.6 - A triggered ability can trigger on its own permanent leaving play. It will still be resolved even if its source is no longer in play. [Mirage, Page 41] For example, an Animate Artifact on a Soul Net will allow you to use the Soul Net's ability when it is killed.
A.8.7 - Triggered abilities which trigger on a permanent leaving play will trigger based on the characteristics of the permanent just before it left play. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
A.8.8 - Triggered abilities which trigger on a permanent coming into play will trigger based on the characteristics on the card or the token-creating ability which generated the permanent. If the card or ability refers to the permanent by name, its identity is also recorded so the effect knows exactly what card/token it is associated with even if the card or token changes names after entering play. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
A.8.9 - Triggered abilities which trigger "for each" damage dealt or "for each" card drawn or discarded, trigger once for the entire amount of damage dealt or the entire number of cards drawn or discarded. So if X cards are drawn in one effect, then you do the trigger X times during a single resolution. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Aahz 06/16/97]
A.8.10 - Triggered abilities which trigger "whenever" damage is dealt or "whenever" a card is drawn, trigger separately for each point of damage dealt or card drawn or discarded. So if X cards are drawn in one effect, then you will have X separate triggered abilities to resolve. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Aahz 06/16/97]
A.8.11 - If a triggered ability gives a player other than the controller of the source of the ability an option to do something, that player is considered to play and control that triggered ability even though they do not control the source of that ability. [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98] For example, Zur's Weirding and Mana Breach. See Rule G.6.Ruling.3.
A.8.12 - If a triggered ability gives each player the option to do something, the controller of the source plays and controls the ability. The controller chooses what they do first, then other players do. [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98] For example, Noble Benefactor. See Rule G.6.Ruling.4.
A.8.Ruling.1 - Because triggered abilities are played using the normal life cycle rules (see Rule T.3), triggered abilities can become nested. For example, if one spell's resolution caused two triggered abilities to trigger, then during the resolution of the first one of these triggered abilities, another effect is triggered. The newly triggered ability is resolved prior to going back and resolving the second of the original pair of triggered abilities. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 26]
A.8.Ruling.2 - Abilities which trigger on you losing control of something also trigger if that something leaves play since you lose control of it when it leaves play. [bethmo 01/15/96]
A.8.Ruling.3 - Multiple abilities can trigger off the same thing happening, but a single permanent's ability will never double-fire off of a single action. For example, if you have two Scavenging Ghouls in play, each will get a counter if a creature dies, but neither will get two counters. [D'Angelo 10/03/96]
A.8.Ruling.4 - If a triggered ability says "if Xxxxx leaves play, do <-something-> to Xxxxx", then the triggered ability will only be able to work if the Xxxxx is still in the same location that it left play to. This is because of the fact that all abilities lose track of a card when it changes zones (see Rule Z.1). For example, if one ability says "If creature leaves play, remove it from the game" and the card is sent to the graveyard, but before you resolve this ability the card is instead sent to the player's hand, the removal from game will fail to happen. [bethmo 06/26/96]
A.8.Ruling.5 - A triggered ability which is set up as part of the resolution of some other spell or ability will not detect changes which happened before it was set up. For example, if a Phantasmal Mount's ability (which includes setting up the triggered ability "If either Phantasmal Mount or the targeted creature leaves play this turn, bury the other.") is used on a creature, and that creature or the Mount leave play before this triggered ability is actually applied, then the trigger will not cause the other one to be buried. [WotC Rules Team 08/08/97]
A.8.Ruling.6 - You can play interrupts, such as from the Silver Wyvern, to a triggered ability. [D'Angelo 04/20/98]
A.8.Ruling.7 - Due to Rule A.8.11 and A.8.12, triggered abilities are always played and controlled by the same player. Only phase abilities can get the odd case where they are played by one player but controlled by another. See Rule A.5.7. [D'Angelo 07/17/98]
A.8.Ruling.8 - An ability that triggers on a permanent leaving play will use the game state at the time right before that permanent left play to answer any questions about things that were in play. This is how the characteristics of the permanent leaving play are determined. A side-effect of this is that a permanent's ability can trigger on itself leaving play or on things leaving play at the same time it does. The ability will also end up seeing all the permanents that left play at the same time it did as being in play as far as the ability is concerned. For example Lifeline checks if other creatures are in play and will see creatures that left play at the same time. [D'Angelo 11/17/98]
Note - A handy way to translate triggers into timing is to change "when" or "if" to "just after" in your head, since triggers are resolved just after the thing that triggers them finishes happening. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]
A.9 - Unactivated Abilities
A.9.1 - On some cards an ability may not be activated (see Rule A.2), continuous (see Rule A.4), triggered (see Rule A.8), or anything else. It is simply an ability which can be optionally used. There is no standard way to write such abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.9.2 - Unactivated abilities are played as an Instant (and are Instants for all reasons) unless otherwise stated (or implied by context to be a triggered ability, phase ability, etc.). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.9.3 - Unactivated abilities may only be used while the permanent is in play unless otherwise stated. See Rule A.1.4. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - One card with an unactivated ability is Ifh-Biff Efreet.
A.10 - Untap Costs
A.10.1 - Untap costs are written as something similar to "You may pay an additional <-cost-> during your upkeep to untap this permanent." All such abilities are associated with a "this permanent does not untap as normal during the untap phase" statement.
A.10.2 - All untap costs are cumulative into a single cost which must be paid all at once in order to untap the permanent. [Fifth Edition, Page 53] For example, an Island Fish Jasconius with two Paralyze spells on it would require a payment of 8UUU to untap it.
A.10.3 - If there are multiple untap costs with different times that they can be paid, then the entire cost can only be paid when the latest of the costs can be paid. For example, if one cost is paid during upkeep and another is paid at the end of upkeep, then the cost is paid at the end of upkeep. [Fifth Edition, Page 53]
A.10.4 - When played during a phase, it is played as an Instant with the cost being paid on announcing, and the untapping happening during the resolution of the ability. When played at the end of a phase, treat it as an end of phase ability (see Rule A.3). See Rule T.1.5.
A.10.5 - Playing an untap cost is optional. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
A.10.6 - When played during a phase, the ability can be played more than once if you want to. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
A.10.Ruling.1 - Any spell ability which untaps a permanent as part of its effect may do so without paying the untap costs. For example, Instill Energy can untap the creature directly. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 15]
A.11 - Banding:
A.11.1 - The ability is written as "Banding". On older cards, the ability was written as "Bands". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.2 - Banding consists of two separate abilities, which can be referred to as "mutual assistance" and "damage sharing". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.3 - Mutual assistance only applies to attacking creatures. It is an agreement that if any one of the attackers is blocked, that the whole group will stop and gang up on the blocker(s). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.4 - When declaring attackers, any number of Banding creatures and up to one creature without Banding may be grouped together in an attacking "band". [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.5 - Use of Banding to attack is optional. [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.6 - Use of Banding to form an attacking band ends at the end of combat. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.7 - If Banding is removed from an attacker after the attacking band is declared, the band will still stay together. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
A.11.8 - If any creature is assigned to block a member of an attacking band, then the creature is also considered to be blocking all other members of that band, even if the creature could not normally block those other creatures. [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.9 - Each attacking creature is a separate source of damage. The creatures are not lumped together into one large source. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.10 - Creatures do not gain or lose abilities when banded to attack. They each keep their separate abilities and identity. [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.11 - Damage sharing only applies when combat damage (see Rule C.1.8) is assigned. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.12 - When resolving damage in combat (on either attack or defense), if at least one creature with Banding ability is present in a group of creatures which are blocked by or which are blocking the same creature, then the group of creatures is subject to damage sharing. [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.13 - Combat damage is divided among a damage sharing group of creatures by the controller of those creatures. This is opposite the normal case where damage is assigned by the controller of the creatures which are dealing the damage (see Rule C.8.5 and Rule C.8.6). [Fifth Edition, Page 29]
A.11.14 - Damage sharing is not optional. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.15 - Damage can be assigned among the creatures in any way desired. It is legal to put zero damage on some and to put more damage than a creature's toughness on another, as long as all of the damage is assigned to a creature. [Fifth Edition, Page 30]
A.11.16 - Banding is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.Ruling.1 - To block an attacking band with a creature, your blocker only needs to be able to block one member of the band for mutual assistance to take effect. For example, a Mesa Pegasus banded with a Fear-enchanted Scathe Zombies can be blocked by either a flying creature (by blocking the Mesa Pegasus) or a black or artifact creature (by blocking the Scathe Zombies). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.Ruling.2 - Creatures do not "band for defense". Even without banding, multiple creatures can block a single attacker. Creatures are assigned as blockers individually. Banding only affects the damage sharing. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.11.Ruling.3 - If a Banding creature dies before damage dealing, then it does not count towards determining if damage sharing applies. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.12 - Bands with Other:
A.12.1 - The ability is written as "bands with other <-creature type->". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.12.2 - When declaring attackers, creatures with Bands with Other ability may "band" together, as per the normal Banding rules (see Rule A.11.3 through Rule A.11.10), with any number of creatures which either have Banding or have the same "bands with other <-creature type->" ability. [Legends Rulecards]
A.12.3 - Use of Bands with Other to form an attacking band is optional. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.12.4 - Use of Bands with Other to form an attacking band ends at the end of combat. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.12.5 - When resolving damage in combat (on either attack or defense), if at least two creatures with the same "bands with other <-creature type->" ability are present in a group of creatures, the group is treated as if a Banding creature were present (see Rule A.11.11 through Rule A.11.15). [Legends Rulecards]
A.12.6 - If Bands with Other is removed from an attacker after the attacking band is declared, the band will still stay together. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
A.12.7 - Bands with Other is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - The Bands with Other ability was introduced in the Legends expansion set and has not appeared in any other expansion.
A.13 - Buyback:
A.13.1 - The ability is written as "Buyback <-cost->". The cost can include mana, sacrifices, loss of life, or any other action on the game. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.13.2 - The Buyback cost is paid when announcing the spell. [Tempest, Page 6]
A.13.3 - The use of Buyback is optional. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.13.4 - If you pay the Buyback cost when you play the spell, then the spell is returned to your hand at the end of resolution, rather than going to your graveyard. [Tempest, Page 6]
A.13.5 - The spell does not go to your hand if it is countered or if it fizzles with regards to all of its targets. In these cases, it simply goes to the graveyard as normal. [Tempest, Page 7]
A.13.6 - Buyback is considered a continuous replacement ability (see Rule A.7.5), and interacts with other continuous replacements as per those rules. [bethmo 01/18/99]
A.13.Ruling.1 - Cost reducing effects can be applied to Buyback costs. [D'Angelo 10/17/97] See Rule K.21.Ruling.1.
A.13.Ruling.2 - If a Buyback spell is cast by someone other than the owner (using Grinning Totem), the Buyback fails and the card goes to the owner's graveyard as normal. This is because Rule A.13.4 specifies the card must be going to your graveyard in order to go to your hand, and when casting an opponent's spell, the card is going to your opponent's graveyard. [D'Angelo 04/05/98]
A.14 - Cumulative Upkeep:
A.14.1 - The ability is written as "Cumulative upkeep <-cost->". The cost can be in mana, sacrifices, loss of life, or any other effect on the game. [Mirage, Page 61]
A.14.2 - As an Instant ability during the controller's upkeep, the controller must either pay or not pay the upkeep. Payment is done during the announcement if it is paid, and is considered paid when the Instant ability resolves. If not paid, the permanent is buried when the Instant ability resolves. [Mirage, Page 61]
A.14.3 - The cost to be paid is one times the cost the first time it is paid, two times the cost the second time, three times the cost the third time, and so on. [Mirage, Page 61] Track the number of times it is paid by adding a counter to the source of the cumulative upkeep upon resolution of the Instant ability. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24] For example, if a card has "Cumulative Upkeep: B and 2 life", you pay B and 2 life on the first upkeep, BB and 4 life on the next upkeep, BBB and 6 life on the next upkeep, and so on. This works out to be the base cumulative upkeep cost times one plus the number of counters. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.14.4 - If cumulative upkeep is not paid for some period of time because the permanent is not in play or was temporarily changed so that it no longer had a cumulative upkeep, the cumulative upkeep tracking is not reset. Payment resumes as soon as it applies. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24] (This is a REVERSAL of Mirage, Page 62)
A.14.5 - Cumulative upkeep is not reset if the permanent changes controllers. [Mirage, Page 62]
A.14.6 - Cumulative upkeep follows all the normal rules for phase costs (see Rule A.6). This means they are merged with other phase costs (see Rule A.6.4). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.14.Ruling.1 - Permanents which count their last paid cumulative upkeep only count their own cumulative upkeep, not ones imposed by other cards. [bethmo 06/20/97] This is because each cumulative upkeep is tracked separately as per Rule A.14.3.
A.14.Ruling.2 - If a new cumulative upkeep is added by adding text to a card, such as with Mana Chains, then the new cumulative upkeep is merged with any existing cumulative upkeep. For example, adding a Mana Chains to a Polar Kraken with a last-paid cumulative upkeep of 6 will require a cumulative upkeep of 7 islands and 7 mana. [D'Angelo 05/28/98] Note that most times the cumulative upkeep is not added by adding text. It is usually imposed by an ability.
A.15 - Cycling:
A.15.1 - The ability is written "Cycling <-cost->". All cards include reminder text defining the ability as "You may pay <-cost-> and discard this card from your hand to draw a card. Play this ability as an instant." [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.15.Ruling.1 - Since the ability is an instant, it can be used at any time instants are legal. [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.15.Ruling.2 - You don't draw the card until the ability resolves, so you cannot play the newly drawn card until the next Batch of spells and abilities. [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.15.Ruling.3 - Using Cycling is not a spell, it's a non-activated ability of a card. It cannot be countered by things which counter spells or things that counter activated abilities of permanents. [Urza's Saga Rule Page] [DeLaney 10/05/98]
A.16 - Echo:
A.16.1 - The ability is written "Echo". All cards include reminder text defining the ability as "During your next upkeep after this permanent comes under your control, pay its casting cost or sacrifice it." [Urza's Saga Rule Page] The rulings are made based on a wording more like "During your upkeep, if this card came under your control between the start of your previous upkeep and the start of this upkeep, pay its casting cost or sacrifice it." [D'Angelo 04/03/99]
A.16.2 - The ability imposes a Phase Cost (see Rule A.6) on the permanent on the turn after you gain control of the permanent. [Urza's Saga Rule Page] This means you cannot use any activated abilities of the permanent until you dealt with this cost (see Rule A.6.9).
A.16.Ruling.1 - The Echo payment is required on the turn after you get control of the creature, regardless of how you got control. This means it happens after you play the permanent, bring the permanent into play with an effect, gain control of the permanent from another player, or through any other means. [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.16.Ruling.2 - Effects which modify the play cost of a spell, like the Emerald Medallion, cannot be used to modify the upkeep cost that you have to pay. They only apply to the announcing of spells, and this is a phase cost. [D'Angelo 10/08/98] The same applies to effects like Gloom. They do not apply to the Echo payment. [D'Angelo 11/25/98]
A.16.Ruling.3 - If you gain and lose control of the card several times before your upkeep, you still only pay the Echo cost once. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
A.16.Ruling.4 - Phasing a permanent in will cause Echo to have to be dealt with. [WotC Rules Team 10/17/98]
A.16.Ruling.5 - If you manage to have it in play through an upkeep, but don't have to pay the echo (for example, if its abilities are ignored due to Humility), then you can manage to avoid the echo payment. [D'Angelo 03/03/99]
A.16.Ruling.6 - If it enters play during your upkeep, you pay during the following upkeep. [Bethmo 03/27/99]
A.17 - Evasion:
A.17.1 - Evasion is not a specific ability, but is instead a category of abilities which limit what creatures can be assigned to block a creature. All of these abilities specify some subset of creatures which cannot block the creature if it attacks. They are usually worded as "<-something-> creatures cannot block this creature" or "this creature cannot be blocked by <-something-> creatures". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.17.2 - Evasion abilities are cumulative. In order to be assigned as a blocker, a creature must not be subject to any of the evasion exclusions. For example, if a creature had "cannot be blocked by black creatures" and "cannot be blocked by walls", then it could only be blocked by a creature that was both not black and not a wall. [Fifth Edition, Page 55]
A.17.Ruling.1 - Evasion abilities only apply to blocker assignment. If a creature becomes a blocker by a means other than assignment, then it is not subject to any evasion abilities. For example, if a creature blocks one member of a band of attackers, it becomes a blocker of other members of the band regardless of any evasion abilities those other members have. See Rule A.11.8. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.17.Ruling.2 - An attacking creature with an evasion ability may not "turn off" the ability and choose to be blockable. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Flying (see Rule A.20), Landwalk (see Rule A.22), Protection (see Rule A.24), and Shadow (see Rule A.26) are evasion abilities.
A.18 - First Strike:
A.18.1 - The ability is written "First strike". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.18.2 - Creatures with First Strike deal combat damage before creatures without it. [Fifth Edition, Page 21] See Rule C.8.1 for exactly when this happens.
A.18.3 - If a creature without First Strike is killed during First Strike damage dealing, then it will not deal combat damage at all. [Fifth Edition, Page 21] See Rule C.8.1.
A.18.4 - First Strike is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. Having First Strike more than once gives no additional effect. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.19 - Flanking:
A.19.1 - The ability is written "Flanking". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.19.2 - Whenever a creature without Flanking is assigned to block a creature with Flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn. [Mirage, Page 1] This is done as a triggered ability.
A.19.3 - Flanking is not a targeted ability. [D'Angelo 05/21/97]
A.19.4 - Flanking is a triggered, cumulative ability. A creature with Flanking twice gives out the -1/-1 twice (a total of -2/-2 but in two separate triggered abilities). [bethmo 09/26/96] See Rule A.1.2 and Rule A.19.2.
A.19.Ruling.1 - This may kill the blocker prior to damage dealing, but the attacker is still blocked. See Rule C.6.10. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.19.Ruling.2 - Flanking does not apply to blockers which are not assigned to the Flanking creature directly. For example, creatures that become blockers due to blocking a member of a band which includes the Flanking creature are not subject to the Flanking -1/-1 ability. [Mirage, Page 1]
A.19.Ruling.3 - Gaining Flanking after blockers are assigned will have no effect on the blockers because the time for Flanking to trigger has already passed. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]
A.19.Ruling.4 - If an attacking creature has multiple instances of the Flanking ability, even one instance of Flanking on the blocking creature will negate the effect. [D'Angelo 06/15/98]
A.20 - Flying:
A.20.1 - The ability is written "Flying". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.20.2 - A creature without Flying cannot be assigned to block a creature which has Flying. [Fifth Edition, Page 20]
A.20.3 - Flying is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. Having Flying more than once gives no additional effect. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.20.Ruling.1 - A creature with Flying can block a creature without Flying. [Fifth Edition, Page 20]
A.20.Ruling.2 - Flying is an evasion ability (see Rule A.17), so it is cumulative with other evasion abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.21 - Landhome:
A.21.1 - The ability is written as "<-land type->home", using a land type in the name. For example, Islandhome. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.21.2 - A creature with Landhome cannot be declared as an attacker unless the defending player controls at least one land of the appropriate land type. [Fifth Edition, Page 21]
A.21.3 - The permanent is buried if the controller does not control any lands of the appropriate land type. [Fifth Edition, Page 21] This is done as a Rules Effect (see Rule T.13).
A.21.Ruling.1 - The land type (if it is a basic type) can be affected by Magical Hack or Mind Bend. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.21.Ruling.2 - If Landhome is ever on a non-creature artifact, land, or enchantment, the ability still functions. [WotC Rules Team 03/01/98]
A.22 - Landwalk:
A.22.1 - The ability is written as "<-land type->walk", using a land type in the name. For example, Swampwalk or Plainswalk. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.22.2 - If the defending player controls any lands of the appropriate land type, then no creatures may be assigned to block the Landwalking creature. [Fifth Edition, Page 20]
A.22.3 - Spells and abilities which look for a kind of Landwalk work even if the Landwalk type is more specific. For example, a spell which targets a creature with Islandwalk will work on a creature with Snow-Covered Islandwalk. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]
A.22.4 - Landwalk of a particular type is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. Having the same type of Landwalk more than once gives no additional effect. See Rule A.1.2.
A.22.Ruling.1 - If the defending player does not control any lands of the appropriate land type, then the ability does nothing. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.22.Ruling.2 - Even creatures with the same Landwalk ability cannot block such creatures if the defending player controls the appropriate land. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.22.Ruling.3 - The land type (if it is a basic type) can be affected by Magical Hack or Mind Bend. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.22.Ruling.4 - Landwalk is an evasion ability (see Rule A.17), so it is cumulative with other evasion abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.23 - Phasing:
A.23.1 - The ability is written "Phasing". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.23.2 - A permanent with Phasing ability will "phase out" (see Rule G.30.1) at the beginning of its controller's untap phase (see Rule P.5). [Mirage, Page 1]
Note - The rules for phasing in and out are described in Rule G.30.
A.24 - Protection:
A.24.1 - The ability is written as "Protection from <-something->". Usually the something is a color (such as "Protection from Black"), but it may be Artifacts or something else. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.2 - Creatures (or other permanents) with this ability have three benefits: [Fifth Edition, Page 30] 1. Reduces damage from <-something-> sources to zero. 2. Cannot have <-something-> creatures assigned to block it. 3. Cannot be targeted by <-something-> abilities, spells, or enchantments.
A.24.3 - Not being targeted by enchantments means that the appropriate local enchantment (Enchant Creature) cards bury themselves if they are ever on the creature. [Fifth Edition, Page 30]
A.24.4 - If this ability is gained during a damage prevention step, it will not reduce any damage already on the creature to zero. It will only affect damage assigned after the Protection starts. [Aahz 02/16/97]
A.24.Ruling.1 - Untargeted spells and abilities can still affect the creature. For example, a Wrath of God can affect a creature with Protection from White because Wrath of God is not targeted. And creatures with Protection from Red are still affected by Orcish Oriflamme. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.2 - Untargeted spells and abilities which do damage will damage the creature, but that damage will be reduced to zero by benefit number one. For example, Pestilence can damage a White Knight since it is untargeted, but the damage is reduced to zero. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.3 - Note that damage prevention spells do not usually target the creature. This means that Healing Salve can be used on a creature with Protection from White. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.4 - Protection will not stop the creature from being sacrificed. See Rule G.35.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.5 - Protection does not protect any enchantments on the creature from being targeted. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.6 - Protection does not work while the creature's card is not in play. For example, a creature with Protection from Black can be targeted by a Raise Dead. See Rule A.1.4. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.7 - Protection includes an evasion ability (see Rule A.17), so it is cumulative with other evasion abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.24.Ruling.8 - If Protection ability is ever on a non-creature artifact, land, or enchantment, the ability still functions. [WotC Rules Team 03/01/98]
A.25 - Rampage:
A.25.1 - The ability is written "Rampage X", where X is a number. For example, "Rampage 2". Some older cards were written "Rampage: X". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.25.2 - A creature with "Rampage X" gains +X/+X until end of turn for each creature beyond the first which is assigned to block it. [Fifth Edition, Page 31] This bonus is added as a triggered ability (see Rule A.8) upon declaration of blockers (see Rule C.6.1).
A.25.3 - Rampage is a triggered, cumulative ability. Having Rampage more than once will cause each Rampage ability to trigger. For example, a creature with Rampage 2 and Rampage 1 will get both the +2/+2 and +1/+1 abilities to trigger for each appropriate blocker assignment. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.25.Ruling.1 - Rampage does not apply to blockers which are not assigned to the Rampage creature directly. For example, creatures that become blockers due to blocking a member of a band which includes the Rampage creature do not count as additional blockers for the Rampage ability. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]
A.25.Ruling.2 - Removing a blocker from the combat does not change the bonus. It is calculated once and lasts until the end of the turn. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.26 - Shadow:
A.26.1 - The ability is written "Shadow". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.26.2 - A creature without Shadow cannot be assigned to block a creature with Shadow. [Tempest, Page 9]
A.26.3 - A creature with Shadow cannot be assigned to block a creature without Shadow. [Tempest, Page 9]
A.26.4 - It is possible for Banding to result in a Shadow creature blocking or being blocked by a non-Shadow creature. This is not illegal. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.26.Ruling.1 - Shadow is a continuous, non-cumulative ability. Having Shadow more than once gives no additional effect. See Rule A.1.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.26.Ruling.2 - Shadow includes an evasion ability (see Rule A.17), so it is cumulative with other evasion abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.27 - Trample:
A.27.1 - The ability is written "Trample". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
A.27.2 - When an attacking creature with Trample assigns combat damage, the player distributing the damage may assign damage to the defending player if the attacking creature is unblocked, has no blockers which can have damage assigned to them, or if lethal damage (see Rule K.12.4) is also assigned to all blockers which can receive combat damage. [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.27.3 - Trample is a continuous, cumulative ability. See Rule A.1.2. Having Trample more than once gives no additional effect. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
A.27.Ruling.1 - The damage from all attackers is assigned to all blockers and players simultaneously.. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
A.27.Ruling.2 - The player distributing the damage can assign more damage to a creature that is needed to kill that creature, and can choose to not assign damage at all to one or more blocking creatures. If any blocking creature is not going to be lethally damaged (see Rule K.12.4), however, no damage may be assigned to the defending player. [Urza's Saga Rule Page] For example, if a Force of Nature (8/8 Trample) is blocked by three 2/2 creatures, you could a) assign all 8 damage to one blocker, b) 4 to each of two blockers, c) 3 to one 3 to another and 2 to the third, c) 3 to one, 2 to each other, and 1 to the defending player, d) 2 to each blocker and 2 to the defending player, and so on.
A.27.Ruling.3 - Blocking creatures which cannot receive combat damage (due to Gaseous Form and similar effects) are simply ignored when assigning damage. [Urza's Saga Rule Page]
A.27.Ruling.4 - If a creature was damaged prior to combat damage being assigned, you only need to assign enough additional damage to make the creature have damage on it equal to its toughness before satisfying the Trample rules. In other words, enough to make the creature have lethal damage (see Rule K.12.4). [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
A.27.Ruling.5 - If a blocking creature has an ability that prevents or redirects damage, this in no way affects how much damage you need to assign to make the blocker have lethal damage (see Rule K.12.4). For example, if a 2/2 creature with Protection from Green blocked a Force of Nature, you would only need to assign 2 damage to it, even though that damage will be prevented by the ability during damage prevention. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
A.27.Ruling.6 - If the Trample creature is blocked, but the blocker is destroyed (or otherwise removed) before damage dealin, the Trample creature deals all of its damage directly to the defending player. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
A.27.Ruling.7 - If a blocking creature is to receive damage from more than one attacking creature because it blocked multiple attackers (due to an ability or because the attackers were Banded), the player assigning the damage may assign the non-Trample creature's damage first in order to maximize the amount that can be assigned to the defending player. (Note that the damage is really assigned all at once, not "first" and "next", but this model works to the same result.) [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
A.27.Ruling.8 - Trample does not apply when blocking. See Rule A.27.2. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
Note - The Trample ability was significantly redefined with the release of Urza's Saga at the beginning of October 1998. Trample used to work in two steps. First damage was assigned completely to the blocking creatures. Any unprevented damage to blockers which had "trample ability" would then get redirected as automatic damage redirection to the defending player. Because of this, it used to be very effective to assign all the damage to one blocker and thereby get the maximum amount of damage through. Trample used to be very uneffective against Protection from Color and en-Kor creature abilities, however. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
C - Combat Rules
C.1 - The Attack Phase
C.1.1 - The attack phase follows a multi-step procedure. The steps are: [Fifth Edition, Page 23] 0. Declare intention to attack during the Main phase 1. Beginning of combat 2. Declare attackers 3. Effects before blocking 4. Declare blockers 5. Effects after blocking 6. Damage dealing 7. End of combat
C.1.2 - All creatures involved in the attack move through all the steps at the same time. In other words, you do not move one attacker through the steps, and then go back and move a different attacker through.
C.1.3 - A creature is only considered an "attacking creature" during steps 3 through 7, or "blocking creature" during steps 5 through 7. [Mirage, Page 49]
C.1.4 - A creature which is removed from combat stops being an attacking or blocking creature. It does not untap. It will not deal or receive combat damage during step 6. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.1.5 - A creature is removed from the combat if it changes controllers or leaves play. It will not rejoin the combat even if it returns to its original controller's control. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.1.6 - A creature is removed from the combat if it regenerates. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.1.7 - A creature is removed from the combat if it stops being a creature. It will not rejoin the combat even if it returns to being a creature. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.1.8 - The terms "combat damage" or "damage in combat" only apply to damage dealt by creatures during the damage dealing step (step 6). Spells and abilities which do damage during the attack phase are not considered "combat damage" or "damage in combat". [Fifth Edition, Page 54] Once damage is redirected, it stops being "combat damage" [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
C.1.9 - A small set of effects can "retroactively" remove a creature from combat. They usually say "treat the creature as if it never attacked". There are some special rules for these cases. See Rule C.4.8, Rule C.6.9, and Rule C.9.3.
C.1.Ruling.1 - Tapping or untapping a creature does not remove the creature from combat. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.2 - Step 0: Declaring intention to attack
C.2.1 - During a player's Main phase (see Rule P.8), they may declare the intention to attack instead of starting a Batch (see Rule T.8). If the opponent responds to this by starting a Batch, then the attack is cancelled (but the player can declare the intent to attack again if they want to). If the opponent does not respond, the attack phase begins.
C.2.Ruling.1 - A player may only declare one attack per turn unless some effect alters this. See Rule P.8.1.
C.2.Ruling.2 - In a multiplayer game, you do not need to declare which player you are attacking at this time. [D'Angelo 01/23/95]
Note - Starting an attack is similar to any phase change in that you cannot go on to declare attackers until your opponent is done doing actions in your main phase.
C.3 - Step 1: Beginning of Combat
C.3.1 - Before starting this step, first check for mana burn (see Rule G.25), then check for players losing the game (see Rule G.22.3).
C.3.2 - During this step, handle anything which triggers on or is scheduled for the beginning of the attack using the normal beginning of phase rules (see Rule P.3 and Rule T.9). For example, Goblin Flotilla has an ability that triggers on the beginning of combat.
C.4 - Step 2: Declare Attackers
C.4.1 - This step can be charted out as follows: [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] a. Chance to use spells and abilities usable during attack declaration. These are played in a Series (see Rule T.9). b. Declaration of attackers. c. Deal with triggered abilities from declaration of attackers. d. Chance to use spells and abilities usable during attack declaration. These are played in a Series (see Rule T.9).
C.4.2 - A creature can be declared as an attacker if it is untapped, does not have summoning sickness (see Rule G.39), is not a Wall (see Rule K.26), and does not have any other effect preventing it from attacking. [Fifth Edition, Page 23] An opponent's Island Sanctuary is an example of a preventing effect.
C.4.3 - Creatures become tapped when they are declared as an attacker (unless some ability or effect says otherwise). [Fifth Edition, Page 23]
C.4.4 - All attackers are declared at once. This action is simultaneous, and it must result in a legal set of attackers. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35]
C.4.5 - If there are creatures that must attack, the attack declaration is illegal if any subset of the creatures that were required to attack but were left out could have been added to the set of attackers. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] See Rule C.10.
C.4.6 - You declare an opponent (not any of your opponent's creatures) to attack. You cannot attack yourself or your own creatures. [Fifth Edition, Page 23]
C.4.7 - No spells or abilities other than ones which explicitly say they can be used when attackers are declared can be used. Mana sources are also allowed. [Mirage, Page 48] If you have anything to play prior to declaring attackers, make sure you play those during the Main phase. Brainwash is an example of an ability usable during this step.
C.4.8 - Triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) which have already been resolved are not undone if a creature is retroactively (see Rule C.1.9) removed from combat. [Aahz 09/09/97] Triggered abilities which have not yet been resolved are cancelled if the creature that triggered it is retroactively removed from combat. [Aahz 08/18/97]
C.4.Ruling.1 - Creatures which have the ability to not tap when attacking, must still be untapped during this step in order to be declared as an attacker. [Mirage, Page 49]
C.4.Ruling.2 - Creatures with a zero power can still attack. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
C.4.Ruling.3 - You can attack with zero creatures. Such an attack is called a "null attack", and it does count as your one attack during your turn. [Fifth Edition, Page 55]
C.4.Ruling.4 - You only check if the creature is allowed to attack (such as can only attack if opponent has Islands) during this step. If any attack enablers are removed or attack inhibitors are introduced later, it does not make a difference. The creature is still attacking. [D'Angelo 02/01/95]
C.4.Ruling.5 - You are not required to maximize the number of attackers or to attack with all "must attack" creatures if those creatures are unable to attack given the choice of attackers you make. So, you can attack with a single creature with Errantry and leave other creatures behind. But if you have an Orcish Conscripts that is required to attack and at least two other creatures attack, it is illegal for the Conscripts to not be included. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] See Rule C.10.
C.4.Ruling.6 - If a creature is retroactively removed from the combat declaration, this will not make other attack declarations illegal. For example, if a Mijae Djinn and two Orcish Conscripts are declared, then the Djinn's ability removes it from the combat, the Conscripts are still attacking. [D'Angelo 04/24/98]
Note - Banding of attackers must be declared at this time and cannot be changed later. See Rule A.11.3.
Note - Most penalties and bonuses due to attacking or not attacking are considered as triggered abilities (see Rule A.8). For example, damage from attacking with the Hasran Ogress. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]
C.5 - Step 3: Instants before Blocking
C.5.1 - During this step any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of instants may be used. [Fifth Edition, Page 24]
Note - This is the ideal time for the defending player to eliminate attackers they do not want to deal with (using Royal Assassin or Lightning Bolt, for example), to to enhance potential blockers (with Jump or such) to allow them to be used for blocking.
Note - Creatures which are destroyed are removed from the combat even if they are regenerated. See Rule C.1.
C.6 - Step 4: Declare Blockers
C.6.1 - This step can be charted out as follows: [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] a. Chance to use spells and abilities usable during block declaration. These are played in a Series (see Rule T.9). b. Declaration of blockers. c. Deal with triggered abilities from declaration of blockers. d. Chance to use spells and abilities usable during block declaration. These are played in a Series (see Rule T.9).
C.6.2 - A creature can be declared as a blocker if it is untapped, and does not have any other effect preventing it from blocking. [Fifth Edition, Page 24] Pacifism is an example of a preventing effect.
C.6.3 - All blockers are declared at once. This action is simultaneous, and it must result in a legal set of blockers. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35]
C.6.4 - A blocker can only be assigned to a single attacker unless otherwise stated on the card. [Fifth Edition, Page 55] Note - if the assigned attacker is a member of a band, then the other members of the band also become blocked (see Rule A.11.3).
C.6.5 - More than one blocker can be assigned to a single attacker. [Fifth Edition, Page 24]
C.6.6 - If there are creatures that must block, the block declaration is illegal if any subset of the creatures that were required to block but were left out could have been added to the set of blockers. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] See Rule C.10.
C.6.7 - If a creature is required to block more creatures than it can legally block, then the defender chooses which creature(s) to block, but must choose to block as many as possible. [Fifth Edition, Page 55]
C.6.8 - No spells or abilities other than ones which explicitly say they can be used when blockers are declared can be used. Mana sources are also allowed. [Mirage, Page 48] If you have anything to play prior to declaring blockers, make sure you play those during Step 3.
C.6.9 - Triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) which have already been resolved are not undone if a creature is retroactively (see Rule C.1.9) removed from combat. This is true even if the ability has a delayed effect. [Aahz 09/09/97] Triggered abilities which have not yet been resolved are cancelled if the creature that triggered it is retroactively removed from combat. [Aahz 08/18/97]
C.6.10 - Once an attacking creature is blocked, it remains blocked even if the blocking creature is removed from the combat (e.g. killed) or if the block is made illegal by some action. [Fifth Edition, Page 55] And since it remains blocked, it won't deal damage to the opponent.
C.6.Ruling.1 - To block, a creature must get around all of the attacking creature's evasion abilities (see Rule A.17). For example, a Flying creature with Fear can only be blocked if the blocking creature has Flying (to satisfy the Flying evasion ability) and if it is Black and/or Artifact (to satisfy the Fear evasion ability).
C.6.Ruling.2 - There is no summoning sickness for declaring blockers. You can use any untapped creature you have. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 36]
C.6.Ruling.3 - You only check if the creature is allowed to block during this step. If any blocking enablers are removed or blocking inhibitors are introduced later, it does not make a difference. The attacking creature is still blocked. [Fifth Edition, Page 55] For example, if your creature is blocked by a non-Flying creature, giving your attacking creature Flying using a Jump spell later will not unblock your creature.
C.6.Ruling.4 - You are not required to maximize the number of blockers or to block with all "must block" creatures if those creatures are unable to block given the choice of blockers you make. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] See Rule C.10.
C.6.Ruling.5 - A creature is "assigned to block" a creature only if it is specifically assigned during this step. The creature may become a blocker by other means, such as blocking a member of an attacking band (see Rule A.11.3), or by an effect such as General Jarkeld or Sorrow's Path. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95] [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 46] See individual card entries to see if they depend on this distinction.
C.6.Ruling.6 - If an ability triggers (see Rule A.8) on assignment of blockers or on blocking, it can only trigger and be checked during this step. The conditions will not be rechecked later. For example, if a Hill Giant blocks an Abomination, it is not marked for destruction. Then if the Hill Giant is Lifelaced to green later, it will not be rechecked to discover that it is now eligible for the effect. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 47]
C.6.Ruling.7 - Defending creatures do not tap. This is one of the oldest myths of the game.
Note - Banding of blockers is not declared during this step, or ever. See Rule A.11.11.
Note - Most penalties and bonuses due to blocking or not blocking are considered as triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) on assigning a blocker. Sometimes these triggers set up an effect to happen at a future time. For example, blocking a or blocking with a Thicket Basilisk triggers its delayed destruction effect. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]
C.7 - Step 5: Instants after Blocking
C.7.1 - During this step any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of instants may be used. [Fifth Edition, Page 24]
C.7.Ruling.1 - This is the last time to use instants before the main phase resumes after the end of combat. Many people try to use instants, such as Fling or Prodigal Sorcerer between the start of damge dealing (in Step 6) and the end of combat. Such plays are not legal. Only damage prevention and redirection, and any abilities that trigger during at that time, can be played during Steps 6 and 7. [D'Angelo 02/15/99]
Note - This is the ideal time for the attacking player to surprise the defender by using spells and abilities to make their creatures more powerful. Howl from Beyond and built in creature abilities are good examples.
Note - Creatures which are destroyed are removed from the combat even if they are regenerated. See Rule C.1.
Note - Killing or otherwise removing the blockers from an attacking creature does not unblock the attacking creature. See Rule C.6.10
C.8 - Step 6: Damage Dealing
C.8.1 - This step can be charted out as follows: a. Determine which creatures have First Strike (see Rule A.18) and which ones do not. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28] b. Creatures which had First Strike in step 'a' deal combat damage simultaneously. c. Damage prevention step (see Rule T.10) for first strike damage. d. Creatures which did not have First Strike in step 'a' deal combat damage simultaneously. e. Damage prevention step (see Rule T.10) for non-first strike damage.
C.8.2 - Blocking creatures only deal damage if they are untapped when their damage dealing step arrives. [Fifth Edition, Page 56]
C.8.3 - Each attacking creature deals damage separately (even if it attacked in a band, see Rule A.11.3). Each blocking creature deals damage separately (even it is blocking with a banding creature, see Rule A.11.11).
C.8.4 - Unblocked attacking creatures deal damage directly to the defending player. Blocked attacking creatures deal damage to their blocking creature(s). Blocking creatures deal damage to the creature(s) they are blocking. [Fifth Edition, Page 24]
C.8.5 - If there is more than one blocker for a given attacker, then the attacking player decides how the damage is split among the blocking creatures. If at least one of the blocking creatures involved has banding, then this is reversed and the blocking player decides how the attacking creature's damage is split up (see Rule A.11.11).
C.8.6 - If there is more than one attacking creature blocked by a single blocker, the blocking player decides how the damage is split among the attacking creatures. If at least one of the attacking creatures involved has banding, then this is reversed and the attacking player decides how the blocking creature's damage is split up (see Rule A.11.11).
C.8.7 - The attacking player always chooses how to assign the damage they are assigning before the defending player chooses. [Fifth Edition, Page 56]
C.8.8 - It is possible for a blocker to end up blocking two un-banded attackers or even two separate banded groups. If there are two groups blocked by one defender, then treat all the creatures as if they were directly blocked. This means that if even one of the blocked creatures has banding, then the attacking player decides how to divide the damage among them. [D'Angelo 04/24/98]
C.8.Ruling.1 - If a creature receives damage during First Strike damage dealing (sub-step 'b'), it may be killed and removed from combat during the damage prevention step that follows (sub-step 'c'). If this happens, the creature does not live to deal damage (sub-step 'd'). [Fifth Edition, Page 21]
C.8.Ruling.2 - Because of sub-step 'a' (see Rule C.8.1), if a creature gains or loses First Strike between First Strike damage dealing and normal damage dealing, it does not change when the creature deals damage.
C.8.Ruling.3 - Even though creatures deal damage separately (see Rule C.8.3), the damage is treated as if it all happened simultaneously (see Rule C.8.1).
C.8.Ruling.4 - When assigning damage among multiple blockers, you can assign it in any way you choose. With all damage going to one blocker, or any division of damage among the blockers, as long as each point of damage is assigned somewhere. [D'Angelo 08/04/98]
Note - A blocked Trample creature which has no blocker to assign damage to instead assigns damage to the defending player as if it were unblocked. See Rule A.27.2.
Note - Damage dealt during sub-step 'c' and 'e' are combat damage. See Rule C.1.8.
C.9 - Step 7: End of Combat
C.9.1 - During this step, handle anything which triggers on or is scheduled for the end of combat using the normal end of phase rules (see Rule P.3 and Rule T.9).
C.9.2 - Before ending this step, first check for mana burn (see Rule G.25), then check for players losing the game (see Rule G.22.3).
C.9.3 - When this step ends, return to the main phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
C.9.Ruling.1 - If a creature is removed from the combat, all "at end of combat" effects that would affect that creature will still work. If the creature is retroactively (see Rule C.1.9) removed from the combat, however, such "at end of combat" effects are removed. [Aahz 09/24/96]
C.10 - Must Attack or Block
C.10.1 - If a creature is forced to attack, it does not have to attack immediately, but it must attack this turn if possible. This means you must declare an attack (if possible) and send the creature out (if possible).
C.10.2 - If it is illegal to attack or block with the creature, then the "must attack" or "must block" can be ignored since it cannot be followed. See Rule C.4.2 to see what makes a creature unable to attack, and Rule C.6.2 to see what makes a creature unable to block.
C.10.3 - If there is a cost to declare the attacker, the fact that it would be required to attack if possible does not require you to pay the cost in order to allow it to attack. For example, you don't have to pay the Brainwash cost on a Juggernaut. If you do pay the cost, it must attack, but if you do not, it does not. [Aahz 01/25/96] This is true even if the enablement cost is zero, as with Dark Maze. [D'Angelo 10/13/97]
C.10.4 - A creature that must attack on a turn, must only attack once that turn. It is not forced into every attack on that turn. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 48]
C.10.Ruling.1 - You are not forced to maximize the number of "must attack" (or block) creatures that you can declare. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] See Rule C.6.6.
C.10.Ruling.2 - If you have a "must attack" creature, and that creature is unable to attack (because it is tapped or something), you still have to declare an attack phase. You can declare zero attackers, though. [D'Angelo 04/24/98]
D - DCI Tournament Rules
D.1 - Tournament Structure
D.1.1 - Tournaments are single elimination, double elimination, round-robin, or Swiss draw format with each round consisting of up to 3 duels during a fixed time limit. [Tournament Rules 10/01/95]
D.1.2 - In the Swiss format, each win of a match gets 3 points and a draw for the match gets 1 point. A "bye" gives a player 3 points.
D.1.3 - A time limit of 45 or more minutes may be placed on a round other than the semi-final or final rounds. A 10 minute warning should be given. The duel is over when the time is called, except the current player has 60 seconds to finish their turn. The turn is considered started if they had already untapped all their cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/95] A time limit may be placed on the final rounds, but it is strongly recommended that the judge not do so. [Aahz 01/14/97]
D.1.4 - The head judge may terminate a match early. If this is done, at least a 30 minute warning must be given. If a game is terminated this way, the judge will give the player who is currently in the middle of their turn a fixed amount of time to finish it. The "middle of the turn" is defined as being after the current player finished their untap phase. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.1.5 - If time runs out before all the games in the match are completed, the player who won the most games wins the match. If time runs out during a game, neither player is considered the winner of that game. If neither player won more games than the other, the match is a draw. If the tournament is an elimination tournament where a player must advance, the judge should declare the player with the higher life total the winner. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.1.6 - Players in a tournament environment that withdraw before the first match will receive a loss for that match and the opponent will receive a win. Players may withdraw between matches without penalty. To withdraw, the proper official must be notified prior to the pairings being assigned for the next round. Failure to do so, such as just wandering out of the tournament area, will result in a loss of the next round for failing to show up. [Update 04/01/97]
D.1.7 - Both players may agree to call a match a draw before the start of the first duel of that match. This is called the "Intentional Draw" rule. This rule does not apply to individual games. This is not considered to break any other rules. It cannot be declared during or just after a duel. Each player receives one match point. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.1.8 - Players can request of the head judge that no spectators be able to watch the match, just tournament officials. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.1.9 - Players in the tournament are never allowed to observe matches by other players in the tournament. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.2 - Deck Registration
D.2.1 - Players may be required by the judge to record their deck contents, including their sideboard. They may also be required to record any movement of cards to and from their sideboard. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.2.2 - When decks are registered, the deck and sideboard must be returned to their original status before the start of each match. If this is not done, the head judge decides if this is worth a Notice, Single Warning, or Double Warning. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.2.3 - If the tournament requires deck registration, any player discovered with a deck that does not match the registration forfeits a duel. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 52] This may be upgraded to forfeiting a match or even ejection if it is not known how long the deck may have been misregistered. [Aahz 01/14/97]
D.2.4 - Be sure to collect your cards after each game. Losing cards to another player may cause your deck to be misregistered or fall below the 60 card minimum. If such a mistake is discovered, the minimum penalty is to forfeit a game. If this is not discovered until a later match, the penalty may be enforced on both players. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3 - Warnings, Penalties, and Ejection
D.3.1 - You are not allowed to waive any penalties imposed by the judge on your opponent. Violation of the floor rules must be enforced. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.2 - Warnings come in five levels. Official warnings must be confirmed by the head judge. a. Caution = A verbal warning, that is not tracked. b. Notice. A verbal warning, that is tracked. Used as grounds to upgrade a later offense to a Warning. Notices are reported to the head judge and may be upgraded. c. Single Warning. An official warning, that is tracked. Normally used for unintentional mistakes that were disruptive to the event. d. Double Warning. An official warning, that is tracked. Normally used for repeat offenses, or where a rules violation resulted in a serious advantage. e. Triple Warning. An official warning, that is tracked. Normally used for cases of cheating or severe unsportsman-like conduct. These result in investigation by the DCI and may result in additional penalties. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.3 - Once three or more official warnings are issued, the head judge may decide to do one of the following: a. Forfeit current or next duel. This is issued if all three warnings were minor in nature, if none of them is a duplicate warning, and they are viewed as being unintentional. b. Forfeit current or next match. This is issued if all three warnings were minor in nature, if none of them is a duplicate warning, and they are viewed as being unintentional. c. Ejection. This is the default penalty for three warnings, and is the required penalty for four warnings. The player is still eligible for any prizes their standing yeilds, but does not play any more games. d. Disqualification. This is issued if the judge believes the player was cheating, or if the player received two Double Warnings or a Triple Warning. The player is not eligible for any prizes. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.4 - Warnings accumulate through the entire event, even if it spans multiple days. They are cleared at the start of the quarterfinals. During the quarterfinals, a warning which was also issued prior to the quarterfinals can cause a Double Warning. [Tournament Rules 10/01/98]
D.3.5 - Being caught cheating will automatically cause disqualification. If the judge believes a player is cheating, but cannot prove it, it is worth a Double Warning. Cheating includes (but is not limited to): receiving outside assistance or coaching, looking at opponents' cards while you are shuffling or cutting their deck, scouting other player's cards or decks, misrepresenting cards, underpaying mana, using marked cards or sleeves, intentionally marking cards or sleeves during play, drawing extra cards, manipulating which cards are drawn from your (or your opponent's) deck (including stacking a deck to separate land and spell cards), deliberately stalling to take advantage of a time limit, and intentionally misrepresenting public information such as life totals, number of cards in your library, and so on. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.6 - Unsportsman-like conduct is not allowed. Profanity and arguing or acting belligerently toward a tournament official will give a warning. Repeat offenses will result in disqualification. The following are automatically considered unsportsman-like conduct: profanity, physical intimidation, arguing excessively with a judge, enlisting the aid of others to scout out competitors' decks, disobeying or disregarding rules for the tournament event, and willfully disobeying a rule by the head judge or tournament manager. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.7 - Collusion to alter the results of a duel or match (meaning trying to get someone to throw a game or match) is considered unsportsman-like conduct. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.3.8 - Players must keep the cards in their hand above the table. First violation is a Single Warning and the second may result in disqualification. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.3.9 - Use of counterfeit cards in decks is considered cheating and is subject to legal action as well. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.10 - A player can always request that a judge check the opponent's deck to see that it only contains legal and genuine Magic cards. [DCI Letter, Jan 1997]
D.3.11 - If a player is found with an illegal deck (as with less than 60 cards), the default penalty is ejection. The head judge may downgrade this to a forfeit of the match. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.12 - If a player leaves a Pro-Tour event without checking out, they are banned from the next equivalent event. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 52]
D.3.13 - Players must take their turns in a timely fashion. Deliberately stalling is not allowed and can give you a warning. Failure to begin a match in a timely way in order to get a psychological advantage is grounds for disqualification. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.3.14 - If the players do not agree on reality (meaning that they do not agree on life totals, number of counters, etc), the judge should issue a Single Warning to both players. If the judge believes that just one of the players is at fault, he may issue the warning to the one player. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.15 - Players are allowed only 5 minutes prior to each duel to determine who plays and who draws, to do sideboarding, and to do deck shuffling. This does not include shuffling/cutting of opponent's deck or declaring any Mulligans (see Rule D.*.*). Violation of this rule is considered stalling and may result in a warning or disqualification as decided by the judge. The head judge may alter this time limit (usually lowering it), but if so, this must be advertised prior to the tournament. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.16 - A limit of one minute is placed on any shuffling during a duel. If the head judge determines that the shuffling is excessive, it is treated as stalling. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.17 - If a player is not in their seat at the start of a round in the tournament, they receive a loss for the first duel in the match. In addition, they lose an additional duel for each 10 minutes they are late, and this can result in losing the match. Players who lose the match this way in the first round are ejected from the tournament. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.18 - If a player feels that another player is cheating or displaying unsportsman-like conduct, they must bring this to the attention of the judge immediately. Not promptly notifying the judge about unsportsman-like conduct means the player waives any possible claims against the tournament officials or tournament organization. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.3.19 - If a player feels that the tournament officials mis-handled a possible conduct violation, they can appeal to the DCI staff. The DCI staff has the final ruling and the player must follow that decision without further argument or difficulties. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.4 - Judges and Rulings
D.4.1 - Decision of the head judge is final. This is true even if the judge turns out later to have made an incorrect ruling. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.4.2 - Decisions on assistant judges can be appealed to the head judge. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.4.3 - All sanctioned title events require a Level III certified judge. Title events include Pro Tour(TM) Qualifiers, Grand Prix(TM) tournaments, Grand Prix Trial tournaments, and Regional Championships. [Tournament Update 08/01/97]
D.4.4 - All pre-release events require a Level II certified judge. [Tournament Update 08/01/97]
D.4.5 - Judges are required to have an updated DCI Tournament Coordinator Handbook and a copy of the current DCI Standard Floor Rules available. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.4.6 - If a judge takes longer than a minute to make a ruling, the players may request that their match be extended by the time the ruling takes. Whether or not this is granted is up to the head judge. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
Note - All sanctioned tournaments require a Level II certified judge. If one is not present, the K value for player ratings will be 1/2 (most often 16). This is cumulative with other decreases in the K value. [Tournament Update 08/01/97] See Rule D.5.9.
D.5 - DCI Rating System
D.5.1 - The DCI has a rating system. Each registered DCI member's wins and losses in sanctioned tournaments are reported to the DCI and are used to calculate the player's rating.
D.5.2 - The DCI tracks ratings in four categories. They are: Classic = Classic (see Rule D.13) and Classic-Restricted (see Rule D.14) formats. Extended = Extended (see Rule D.15) and Extended Block Constructed (see Rule D.18) formats. Limited = Sealed Deck (see Rule D.17) and Booster Draft (see Rule D.19) formats. Standard = Standard (see Rule D.16) and Standard Block Constructed (see Rule D.18) formats. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.5.3 - All players start with a rating of 1600.
D.5.4 - People who have played less than 25 matches (best 2 of 3) are considered to have a 'provisional rating'. After that, scores should be accurate to within plus or minus 56 points.
D.5.5 - During 'provisional rating' period, a person's rating is: (Rc) + ((400 * (wins - losses)) / number of matches) Rc = Average rating of all opponents (at the time the match against that opponent was played). This rating is re-calculated after each match.
D.5.6 - Once a player is off of provisional rating, their score changes with each match: New Score = (Old Score) + (K * (W - We)) K = 32 for ratings of 0-2099, 24 for 2100-2399, 16 for 2400 and up. W = 1 for a win, 0 for a loss. We = 1 / ((10^D)+1). D = (difference between your and opponent's ratings) / 400. D is always a positive number.
D.5.7 - Scores only count in officially sanctioned tournaments and if the tournament coordinator actually sends the results to WotC.
D.5.8 - Tournaments with less than 8 people do not count in the ratings system. Ones with 8 to 31 people use a K value of 1/2 the above (most often 16). [Tournament Update 08/01/97]
D.5.9 - For sanctioned tournaments without a Level II certified judge, the K value will be 1/2 (most often 16). This is cumulative with other decreases in the K value. [Tournament Update 08/01/97]
D.6 - Card Text To Use
D.6.1 - All DCI tournaments are played as per the most recent text on cards. This means you play all cards as if they read like the most recent English language version of the card (plus errata). [Tournament Rules 10/01/96] When Oracle (a complete card reference) is available, it should be used. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.6.2 - You may play cards from older or newer printings and expansions which bear the same name as a card which is allowed in the tournament format. Regardless of printing, however, Rule D.6.1 applies. [Aahz 07/13/97]
D.6.3 - Non-English language cards are played as the most recent English language version of that card. Translational errors are avoided in this way. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96] For misprinted cards with the wrong art, the card name is what is used to make a match. If the head judge determines that the misleading art is being used to create an advantage, they can consider this as cheating. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.6.Ruling.1 - Rule D.6.1 applies even if the cards from the most recent edition are not actually legal in the tournament format. For example, the Fifth Edition text of Cloak of Confusion would be used when playing in an Ice Age/Homelands/Alliances tournament. [Aahz 07/13/97]
D.6.Ruling.2 - Mixed language decks are legal. [Aahz 07/09/95]
D.7 - Card Sleeves
D.7.1 - Card sleeves are allowed on cards, but the judge or opponent in a specific duel may request that they be removed. If this is requested, it must be complied with. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.7.2 - If sleeves are used, all cards in the deck, library and sideboard must be identically wrapped. If holograms are on the sleeves, they must be on the face (not the back) of the cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.7.3 - Players can ask the judge to inspect the sleeves and can disallow them if they are obviously marked, worn, or in a poor condition that may interfere with shuffling. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.7.4 - Black-backed sleeves are allowed but are subject to the normal sleeve removal rule. The deck must be fully legal without the sleeves. [DCI Letter Jan 1997]
D.7.5 - New card sleeves and/or protective devices are not permitted until the DCI gives its official approval. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.7.Ruling.1 - You can always use a card sleeve as a reminder when placing one of your cards in your opponent's territory. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.8 - Deck Contents
D.8.1 - Players cannot change the contents of their deck and sideboard throughout the entire tournament, but cards can be rotated between the deck and sideboard between games. The sideboard (if used at all) must always have exactly 15 cards (except in Sealed Deck tournaments). [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.8.2 - If a deck contains Alpha printing cards, it must consist entirely of them. You should also inform the head judge that your deck is so constructed. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.8.3 - Using "proxy" cards is not allowed. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.9 - Shuffling
D.9.1 - After whatever normal shuffling you do, you are required to do three "riffle shuffles" (this is the standard shuffle technique of dividing the deck in half and then placing the ends of the two halves together and rapidly interleaving them as they fall together). [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.9.2 - Your opponent is always entitled to shuffle your deck before each duel begins if they want to. They get the right to a final shuffle if they want it. [Mirage, Page 46] This is to prevent people from possibly stacking the deck. Usually people just settle for "cutting the deck".
D.9.3 - Your opponent is always entitled to shuffle or cut your deck after any shuffle during a game. They may not use this opportunity to view cards in your deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.10 - Rules of Play
D.10.1 - If you "forget" to pay upkeep before drawing your card or otherwise proceeding, you must go back and deal with all mandatory upkeep effects, but optional ones are all considered to go unpaid (with the stated results). [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.10.2 - Players may not play for ante. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.10.3 - After drawing your initial hand for a game, you have the option of calling a Mulligan. To do this, simply shuffle your hand back into your library and draw a hand with one fewer cards. For example, if you Mulligan once, you start the game with just 6 cards in your hand, not 7. [Tournament Rules 09/01/98]
D.10.4 - The player who is to play first chooses whether or not to Mulligan first. Once that player stops calling Mulligans, the other player chooses if they want to. [Tournament Rules 09/01/98]
D.10.5 - As per the game rules, the first player each game skips their draw phase (see Rule P.1.3). The winner of the coin toss before the each match decides if they want to play first or to draw first. [Mirage, Page 46]
D.10.Ruling.1 - In previous tournament rules, the standard Mulligan was done if a player had no land cards in their initial hand of 7 cards (and had to reveal their hand to their opponent). Each player got one free Mulligan without losing a card from their hand, and had no option for additional Mulligans. If one player called a Mulligan, the other player also had the option to redraw their hand for no cost. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.11 - Sideboard
D.11.1 - A sideboard is a set of cards which are part of the tournament along with your deck.
D.11.2 - A sideboard in all constructed deck formats is exactly 15 cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.11.3 - Sideboards are optional. If a player chooses not to use one, they must inform their opponent prior to the start of the match. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.11.4 - After each duel, a player may swap cards in their deck with cards in their sideboard. This is a 1-for-1 swap so both the deck and sideboard remain the same size. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.11.5 - In sealed deck tournaments, all the remaining cards not in your play deck are considered your sideboard. And Rule D.11.4 is ignored.
D.11.6 - Players cannot look through their sideboards during play. [Tournament Rules 09/01/98]
D.12 - Other Rules
D.12.1 - Players must bring a way to visibly count life totals during play. For example, counters, dice, pen and paper, etc. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.12.2 - Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish deck contents as well as transcripts or video of any sanctioned tournament. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.13 - Classic Tournament Format
D.13.1 - This is also called "Type I" tournament style.
D.13.2 - Decks can be composed of cards from any edition or expansion of Magic which use the normal card back (unless the judge says otherwise). Collector's Edition cards are not allowed.

D.13.3 - Portal cards are not allowed unless they have the same name as a legal card. In this case, they play as the legal card text and not the Portal card text. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 44]
D.13.4 - New card sets become effective on the first day of the month following their introduction. If a set is released after the 15th day of a month, then the set's effective date is pushed out to the first of the second month. For example, a set released on January 8th is legal on February 1st, and one released on January 25th is legal on March 1st. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97] [bethmo 02/24/99]
D.13.5 - Minimum of 60 cards in a deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]

D.15.Ruling.2 - Square edged cards from the Collector's Editions are not legal.
D.15.Ruling.3 - Silver bordered cards from Unglued are not legal.
Note - The DCI originally released this tournament format on 05/01/97 as a replacement for Classic-Restricted but decided on 06/01/97 to change this decision and support both formats.
D.16 - Standard Tournament Format
D.16.1 - This is also called "Type II" tournament style.
D.16.2 - Decks can be composed of cards from the most recent edition of The Gathering (currently Fifth Edition) and all sets from the two most recent "blocks" (currently Tempest-Stronghold-Exodus and Urza's Saga-Urza's Legacy). A "block" is a stand-alone set and the two expansion sets which follow it. This means that cards stay in use for approximately two years. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.16.3 - Cards from previous editions or expansions which are in the current one are allowed. Collector's Edition and promo cards (which do not appear in a currently allowed set) are not allowed.
D.16.4 - Portal cards are not allowed unless they have the same name as a legal card. In this case, they play as the legal card text and not the Portal card text. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 44]
D.16.5 - New card sets become effective on the first day of the month following their introduction. If a set is released after the 15th day of a month, then the set's effective date is pushed out to the first of the second month. For example, a set released on January 8th is legal on February 1st, and one released on January 25th is legal on March 1st. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97] [bethmo 02/24/99]
D.16.6 - The policy for removal of sets is that each new edition of the base set replaces the previous edition. A new standalone set will start a new block, and thereby replace the oldest "block" in use. A new limited expansion will add itself to the current "block.
D.16.7 - Minimum of 60 cards in a deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.16.8 - Optional 'sideboard'. If you have one, it must be exactly 15 cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.16.9 - No more than 4 of any card which is not a basic land can be in the combination of deck and sideboard. Cards with different art or in different languages or from different prints but which are the same card are considered the same. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.16.10 - There is no 'restricted' list at this time. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.16.11 - These cards are explicitly banned even though they are from legal sets: [Tournament Update 12/01/98] [Update 03/01/99] Dream Halls, Lotus Petal, Time Spiral, Earthcraft, Memory Jar, Tolarian Academy, Fluctuator, Recurring Nightmare, Windfall
D.16.Ruling.1 - Snow-Covered lands are not legal because Ice Age is not legal.
D.16.Ruling.2 - Square edged cards from the Collector's Editions are not legal.
D.16.Ruling.3 - Silver bordered cards from Unglued are not legal.
D.17 - Sealed Deck Formats
D.17.1 - Each player is given some number of unopened starter decks and/or booster packs. The DCI recommends 90 to 300 cards be given out. The standard way to do it is to provide one starter deck plus two 15 card boosters. The judge may also allow additional (usually 4) basic lands to be added to this. [Tournament Rules 10/01/96]
D.17.2 - 45 minutes are given to construct the deck.
D.17.3 - Expansions are valid for sealed deck play as soon as they are released. There is no 30 day wait period. [Tournament Rules 10/01/95]
D.17.4 - Minimum of 40 cards in the play deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.17.5 - All additional cards function as the 'sideboard'. The sideboard and deck size can change freely between duels. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.17.6 - Games are not played for ante. If a player gets a card that can only be played for ante, they should bring it to the head judge, who will replace it from a random stack of cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.17.7 - There are no restricted or banned cards. Ante cards are an exception (see Rule D.17.6). [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.17.8 - There is no "4 of a single card" limit. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.18 - Block Constructed Deck Formats
D.18.1 - These formats follow the Standard (Type II) tournament rules for deck construction but only allow cards from a given "block" rather than from the larger list of sets.
D.18.2 - The current "blocks" are: Ice Age/Homelands/Alliances, Mirage/Visions/Weatherlight, and Tempest/Stronghold/Exodus, and Urza's Saga/Urza's Legacy.
D.18.3 - Some cards are 'banned' from the Ice Age/Homelands/Alliances format so that none may appear in a deck or sideboard. These cards are: [Tournament Rules 10/01/97] Amulet of Quoz, Thawing Glaciers, Timmerian Fiends, Zuran Orb This format is sanctioned as an Extended format. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.18.4 - Some cards are 'banned' from the Mirage/Visions/Weatherlight format so that none may appear in a deck or sideboard. These cards are: [Tournament Update 06/01/97] Squandered Resources
D.18.5 - Some cards are 'banned' for the Tempest/Stronghold/Exodus format so that none may appear in a deck or sideboard. These cards are: [Tournament Update 06/01/98] Cursed Scroll
D.18.5 - Some cards are 'banned' for the Urza's Saga/Urza's Legacy format so that none may appear in a deck or sideboard. These cards are: [Tournament Update 03/01/99] Memory Jar, Time Spiral, Windfall
D.18.Ruling.1 - Only cards explicitly banned from this format are banned. The Standard (Type II) tournament list is not necessarily true.
D.19 - Booster Draft Formats
D.19.1 - Players sit in groups of 7 or 8 players.
D.19.2 - In "Rochester Draft" format, each group starts with 3 booster packs per player. The judge lays out one booster pack (15 cards) on the table and players are given 20 seconds to review the cards. The first pick starts with the player on the judge's left and players pick one card each going around the table to the left. The second booster pack goes around the table to the right, starting on the judges' right. When the rotation gets to the last player, they pick 2 cards and the rotation reverses direction until the booster pack is depleted. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.3 - Each player gets 5 seconds to select a card, and touching one is considered selected. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.4 - Ante cards in initial boosters are replaced by tournament officials from a random stack of cards. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.5 - 20 minutes are given to construct the deck after drafting is complete. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.6 - Players may add as many basic lands as they want to the deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.7 - Minimum of 40 cards in the play deck. All other cards function as the sideboard (as in sealed deck play). [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
D.19.8 - As an optional format, the judge may have players play Swiss format among their group with winners advancing every 3 to 4 rounds to new groups, where they draft up a new deck. [Tournament Rules 10/01/97]
E - Extracted Rulings on Cards
E.1 - Attack or Die Effects
E.1.1 - Spells and abilities may be used to force a creature to attack or be destroyed. These include Siren's Call and Norritt.
E.1.2 - These spells and abilities may only be used on a creature on its controller's turn at a time when it would be legal for that player to declare an attack later in that turn. [Aahz 04/11/95]
E.1.3 - The affected creature must attack if it is able. See Rule C.10 for more information on what this means.
E.1.4 - The creature is destroyed (usually at end of turn, see Rule P.10.1) if it does not attack.
E.1.Ruling.1 - The creature is destroyed if it does not attack because it simply cannot do so legally. For example, a Sea Serpent will be destroyed if it cannot attack because the opponent has no islands. [Aahz 1994]
E.1.Ruling.2 - You can use these spells and abilities on a creature you know won't be able to attack. For example, you can use them on a tapped creature. [Aahz 1994]
E.1.Ruling.3 - If the player cannot declare an attack due to an effect such as Festival, then these spells and abilities are not legal. See Rule E.1.2.
E.1.Ruling.4 - Most of these spells and abilities say they may not be used on a creature which has summoning sickness. [D'Angelo 08/18/98]
Note - Also see Must Attack, Rule C.10.
E.2 - Cantrips
E.2.1 - A 'cantrip' is a spell which has an effect and also lets you draw a card to replace it. This can be done as part of the resolution, or it may be done at the beginning of the next turn.
E.2.Ruling.1 - If instructed to draw at the beginning of the next turn, do so regardless of which player's turn that is. You'll often be drawing at the beginning of your opponent's turn. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]
E.2.Ruling.2 - If the spell has a target and it fizzles (see Rule G.19) with respect to all its targets, then you will not get to draw a card. See Rule G.41.6.
E.2.Ruling.3 - If the spell is countered, you do not get to draw a card. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8] See Rule G.8.3.
Note - Many olders cards said "Draw a card at the beginning of the next turn's upkeep". All such cards have errata to say "Draw a card at the beginning of the next turn". [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28] See the individual card rulings for details.
E.3 - Comes Into Play Abilities
E.3.1 - A card which says "When <-name of this card-> comes into play, do <-something->" sets up a triggered ability (see Rule A.8) which will trigger only on itself coming into play. After that, the ability is inactive. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.3.2 - A card which says "Whenever <-description of a class of permanents-> comes into play, do <-something->" setup up a continuous ability (see Rule A.4) that lasts as long as this card is in play and watches for anything matching the description. Cards with this ability will not trigger on itself entering play or on anything that enters play at the same time this card enters play. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] For example, if two Mogg Bombers enter play simultaneously due to Living Death, neither Mogg Bomber will trigger.
E.3.3 - If the action part of the 'comes into play' ability is worded as "Do <-something->, or do <-something else->" or as "Do <-something->. If you cannot, do <-something else->.", then you are unable to use any activated abilities of that permanent until after the 'comes into play' ability's effect is resolved. Not even mana source abilities of that permanent can be used. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 25] This is pretty much the same as Rule A.6.9 for Phase Costs. For example, Balduvian Trading Post requires you to sacrifice an untapped land or bury it. This means you cannot tap it for mana until after you sacrifice the land.
E.3.Ruling.1 - You can cast a spell that has a 'comes into play' ability even if you know that the ability itself cannot be played. For example, you can cast a Nekrataal when there are no legal creatures in play to target. Simply ignore any 'comes into play' abilities when deciding if you can play a spell. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
E.3.Ruling.2 - If the spell is countered (see Rule G.8), the permanent does not come into play so the ability does not trigger. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
E.3.Ruling.3 - If the card does not say there is a penalty for being unable to do the action, there is no penalty if you are unable to do it. You still do as much of the action as possible.
E.3.Ruling.4 - Continuous effects that will apply after the permanent is in play are ignored when deciding which abilities do and do not trigger. See Rule A.8.8. For example, if you play a land while Living Lands is in play, abilities which trigger off a land coming into play will trigger, but ones that trigger off a creature coming into play will not. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 34]
E.3.Ruling.5 - Since these are triggered abilities (see Rule A.8), you can only play mana sources (plus other triggered abilities) between the time the card enters play and the time the triggered ability is played. [bethmo 11/06/96] This means you cannot use an instant speed ability, such as Altar of Dementia to sacrifice the card before you deal with its 'comes into play' ability. Also note that Rule E.3.3 applies.
E.3.Ruling.6 - You can play interrupts, such as from the Silver Wyvern, to a 'comes into play' ability. [D'Angelo 04/20/98]
E.3.Ruling.7 - 'Comes into play' abilities trigger no matter how the card is put into play. There is only one exception--phasing a card in will never trigger such abilities. See Rule G.30.9.
E.3.Ruling.8 - 'Comes into play' abilities do not trigger when a card changes its type. For example, animating a land with Living Lands. They only trigger on something going from being out of play to being in play. [D'Angelo 07/30/98]
Note - Also see Triggered Abilities, Rule A.8.
E.4 - Copy Cards
E.4.1 - Some cards in the game can become (or make) exact copies of other cards. These cards include Clone, Copy Artifact, Dance of Many, Echo Chamber, Fork, Unstable Shapeshifter, Vesuvan Doppelganger, and Volrath's Shapeshifter. Some copy cards can change what they copy and therefore have additional rules.
E.4.2 - Copy cards read the base characteristics (see Rule K.4) of the card or token, ignoring any changes made by other spells and abilities. These characteristics become the base characteristics of the copy. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.3 - When the copy card is cast and it resolves, it is in all ways a copy. This means that anything which happens when it resolves or when it enters play will happen. For example, a copy of a Tetravus will enter play with three counters. And a copy of a Nevinyrral's Disk will enter play tapped. [WotC Rules Team 07/27/94]
E.4.4 - A copy card does not keep any of its own characteristics (see Rule K.4) unless otherwise stated on the card. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] This means it assumes the name, color, casting cost, and other characteristics.
E.4.5 - When copying a permanent in play, treat any X in the casting cost of that card as zero. [WotC Rules Team 07/27/94] For example, a Clone of a Krakilin will enter play with zero counters.
E.4.6 - If the copy card can change forms, any ability usage restrictions are kept. If a permanent had "use this ability only once per turn" or "you can spend no more than <-amount of mana-> this way each turn", and it changes to another permanent with the exact same ability, the restriction will carry over. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] This means that switching forms to the same creature you were copying will not allow you to get around the restriction.
E.4.7 - If the copy card can change forms, it does not trigger any "comes into play" abilities (see Rule E.3) when it changes to a new form. [D'Angelo 03/31/98] This means that changing to a Nekrataal will not allow you to bury a creature.
E.4.8 - If the copy card can change forms, it does not get any counters or other benefits (or penalties) the copied permanent would get when cast, nor do you have to pay any costs that are normally paid when playing that permanent. [WotC Rules Team 07/27/94] For example, when switching to a Tetravus it gets no counters. And when switching to a Minion of the Wastes you do not pay any life.
E.4.9 - If the copy card can change forms, it does not trigger any "leaves play" effects when it changes to a copy a different permanent. But, any effects which were waiting for it to leave play will trigger when the copy card itself leaves play. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] For example, if a Vesuvan Doppelganger is a copy of a Gaea's Liege and it changes to a new form, the lands it changed into Forests will not revert until the Doppelganger's card actually leaves play.
E.4.10 - Whenever a card refers to itself by name, it means "this card" even if it changes its name by changing what it is copying. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.1 - Most copy cards are targeted and therefore cannot be cast or otherwise brought into play without a legal target (see Rule G.41.1). If the target becomes invalid after announcing but before resolution, the spell or ability fizzles (see Rule G.41.4). In the case of a spell, it goes to the graveyard. In the case of an ability, it has no effect. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]
E.4.Ruling.2 - If a copy card is brought into play by a means other than casting, then you must choose a target at the time it would enter play. See Rule G.31.4.
E.4.Ruling.3 - Because of Rule E.4.2, a copy card cannot copy something which is only of the appropriate type due to an effect. The copy card ignores all effects on the thing it is copying. For example, Clone can only copy token creatures and permanents which are "Summon" or "Artifact Creature" cards. It may not copy a land which is a creature due to Kormus Bell's effect. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.4 - If a copy card copies another permanent which is a copy, then the base values on that permanent are used, which will be the base values from the thing that permanent copied. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] For example, Copy Artifact may be used to copy a Clone of an Artifact Creature.
E.4.Ruling.5 - If a copy card copies a permanent which has characteristics defined when it enters play, such as Primal Clay, it will copy the existing characteristics rather than allow you to choose new ones. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.6 - Effects played on the copy card override the characteristics it is copying. For example, a Vesuvan Doppelganger with a Flight enchantment on it will still be Flying after changing forms. And a Vesuvan Doppelganger modified by Ashnod's Transmogrant will act as a Transmogrified version of the creature it copies even if it changes creatures. [Aahz 08/08/94]
E.4.Ruling.7 - You can copy a creature which is only in play due to an effect such as Animate Dead. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
E.4.Ruling.8 - Creature copy cards can copy a Licid which is in enchantment form, because it is at the base a Summon Card. [bethmo 10/09/97] See Rule E.4.2.
E.4.Ruling.9 - A copy card of a token creature is still a card and not a token. [WotC Rules Team 1994]
E.4.Ruling.10 - If the copy card can change forms, and it changes to copy a Legend (see Rule K.19) in play, it will be the newer copy of that Legend in play and will be buried (see Rule K.19.1) even if the copy card itself was in play longer. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.11 - If the copy card can change forms, and it in turn copies another card which can change forms it will have both copy abilities. But the next form change will erase all the previous copy abilities and it will once again have just one ability. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.12 - Copy cards do not copy Magical Hack or Sleight of Mind changes. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
E.4.Ruling.13 - A copy card can target a creature which has a built-in "cannot be targeted" ability which has been temporarily removed by an effect such as Humility. [bethmo 05/02/98]
E.4.Ruling.14 - All text is copied, including "counts as" text. [bethmo 07/07/98]
Note - Also see Characteristics, Rule K.4.
E.5 - Face Down Cards
E.5.1 - A couple of cards allow you to turn your creatures face down so they cannot be viewed by your opponents. These cards are Camouflage and Illusionary Mask.
E.5.2 - Only the controller of the face down creature can look at it.
E.5.3 - At the time you announce a spell or ability that would target the face down creature, the game rules consider the card to be a creature, but do not know anything else about it. Upon resolution, however, the game gets to know the "truth" and the spell may fizzle (see Rule G.19). [PPG Page 57] For example, you can target a black face down creature with Terror, but the spell will fizzle when it resolves.
E.5.4 - At the time you announce blockers, the game rules consider the card to be a creature but do not know anything else about it. After the blockers are declared, however, the game gets to know the "truth" and any illegal blocking assignments do not happen. The player cannot choose a different blocking assignment for the illegal blockers. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]
E.5.5 - Any continuous effects (or Rule Effects, see Rule T.13) to face down creatures still take effect. You must inform the other players of any relevant effects as soon as those effects get checked. For example, a face down Goblin King would require you to inform players that your Goblin can Mountainwalk as soon as you use that ability. And to inform them that their Goblin is a 2/2 creature as soon as there is a reason to check the Goblin's power or toughness. [Aahz 12/01/97]
E.5.Ruling.1 - Only the creature is face down. Enchantments on it say face up and counters on it are visible. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]
E.5.Ruling.2 - Face down token creatures need not still be shown as tokens in play. You can use cards to mark them so your opponent cannot tell them apart. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]
E.5.Ruling.3 - If a blocking assignment is cancelled by Rule E.5.4, no abilities that trigger on blocking assignment will happen. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
E.5.Ruling.4 - Because of Rule E.5.4, a face down creature with Lure on it must be blocked by all of your opponent's creatures even if you know that the block will be illegal because the attacker has a Landwalk ability (see Rule A.22) or some other evasion ability (see Rule A.17). [D'Angelo 11/21/95]
E.5.Ruling.5 - If a copy card like Clone is used to copy a face down creature, you do not tell that player anything about their creature until there is a need to know, as with Rule E.5.5. [bethmo 1994]
E.5.Ruling.6 - If you have a face down Legend (see Rule K.19) in play and a duplicate Legend is brought into play, you must inform them and have the duplicate buried. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94] See Rule E.5.5.
E.6 - Fog Effects
E.6.1 - A fog effect is an effect that prevents a creature from dealing or receiving combat damage (see Rule C.1.8).
E.6.Ruling.1 - Only damage dealt during the damage dealing step in the attack phase is stopped by a fog effect. Damage from spells and abilities which is done during the attack phase is not stopped. See Rule C.1.8.
E.6.Ruling.2 - Does not prevent a creature from being affected by a blocking ability such as Thicket Basilisk's. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 8]
E.6.Ruling.3 - Does not prevent Is Not Blocked abilities (see Rule E.7) from being used. [Aahz 12/19/94]
E.6.Ruling.4 - If a single creature is under a Fog effect and it is a member of a band, it can still contribute Banding (see Rule A.11) to the band. [Aahz 08/31/94]
E.7 - Is Not Blocked Ability
E.7.1 - An ability written as "If <-this card-> attacks and is not blocked, you [may] do <-something->" is known as an 'Is Not Blocked' ability or as a 'saboteur' ability.
E.7.2 - This is a triggered ability (see Rule A.8) that triggers on the declaration of blockers if the creature is attacking and it was not blocked. [Aahz 08/18/97] If the ability is optional, you have to decide at that time if you want to play it. You cannot wait until later. [Aahz 03/17/97]
E.7.3 - If a creature has multiple Is Not Blocked abilities, even multiple copies of the same ability, all of them can be used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 6]
E.7.Ruling.1 - Abilities written as "<-cost->: do <-something->. Use this ability only if <-this card-> is attacking and is unblocked" are played as instants after the declaration of blockers (see Rule C.7). [Aahz 08/18/97] Also see Rule G.44.
E.7.Ruling.2 - It is common for these abilities to have a targeted part and an untargeted part of making the attacking creature not deal damage. If the targeted part of the ability fizzles (see Rule G.19), then the untargeted part also fizzles and the creature can deal damage as normal (see Rule G.41.6). [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]
E.7.Ruling.3 - The ability can be used even if a fog effect or some other Is Not Blocked ability has made it so the creature cannot deal damage. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 6]
E.8 - Licids
E.8.1 - A Licid is a type of creature that can become a creature enchantment, reside on other creatures for a while, and then revert back to being a creature. [Tempest, Page 7]
E.8.2 - When a Licid becomes a creature enchantment, it loses all abilities and gains whatever ability is listed in the card text. It also stops being whatever kind of permanent it was and becomes a local creature enchantment (see Rule K.14.3). It retains all other characteristics (see Rule K.4) including name, color, and so on. [Tempest, Page 8] [WotC Rules Team 12/18/97]
E.8.3 - The Licid ability targets the creature it will be enchanting. If the target becomes illegal before the ability starts to resolve, then the ability fizzles (see Rule G.19) and the Licid will remain unchanged. [Tempest, Page 9]
E.8.4 - When a Licid changes form, any counters, effects, and damage on it remain on it until they would normally be removed (if ever). If the counters or effects make no sense when applied to the current card type, then they do not do anything. But if the Licid returns to being a of the proper card type, they may take effect again. [D'Angelo 07/24/98] For example, a +1/+1 counter from Dwarven Weaponsmith would remain, the effect of Giant Growth will wear off at end of turn, and damage will be removed at end of turn. Also see Rule K.5.9.
E.8.Ruling.1 - Generally, the cost of using a Licid's ability includes tapping it. This means that when it moves onto the creature, it will be a tapped local enchantment. The enchantment's ability will work normally, though, and the card will untap during your next untap phase. [Tempest, Page 9]
E.8.Ruling.2 - A Licid will not get summoning sickness by enchanting an opponent's permanent. You are still controlling the Licid. [D'Angelo 10/15/97]
E.8.Ruling.3 - If a Licid is enchanting a creature that phases out, the Licid phases out with the creature, but when it phases back in it will phase in as a normal creature and not a creature enchantment. This is because the "change to an enchantment" effect ended when the Licid left play. [Aahz 11/16/97]
E.8.Ruling.4 - When in creature enchantment form, it can be moved onto another creature with an enchantment moving spell or ability (see Rule E.9). It stays as an enchantment. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
E.8.Ruling.5 - If a Licid targets itself with its ability, the effect turns the Licid into a creature enchantment targeting itself. After the resolution finishes, it will discover that it is not on a legal target and it will bury itself. See Rule K.14.9. [WotC Rules Team 08/01/98]
E.8.Ruling.6 - If a Licid imposes an upkeep ability or cost on something, then changes away from an enchantment and back into an enchantment, the upkeep ability or cost on the enchanted creature is a new one and must be dealt with again. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
E.8.Ruling.7 - If any phase costs or phase abilities are placed on the Licid are dealt with while in one form, then it changes form and changes back it will not have to deal with the phase cost or phase ability again. It is still the same permanent the whole time. [D'Angelo 03/23/98]
E.8.Ruling.8 - The ability to end the Licid's effect of being turned into an enchantment is played as an instant. [D'Angelo 07/22/98]
E.9 - Moving Enchantments
E.9.1 - Several spells and abilities can result in the moving of a local enchantment from one permanent to another. For example, Enchantment Alteration and Crown of the Ages.
E.9.2 - When moving an enchantment, nothing changes about the enchantment other than its target. [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98] This rule overrides text in the Fifth Edition rulebook.
E.9.3 - The enchantment is not considered as if "just cast". [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98] This rule overrides text in the Fifth Edition rulebook and on the cards.
E.9.4 - You cannot try to move an enchantment onto an illegal target. Creatures which cannot be targeted by enchantments in play, such as Bartel Runeaxe, or ones with Protection from Color (see Rule A.24) are illegal targets. [WotC Rules Team 05/26/96]
E.9.Ruling.1 - None of the enchantment moving spells and abilities require the targeting of the new destination of the enchantment, so you can move the enchantment onto a permanent that could not normally be targeted by a spell or ability. [Mirage, Page 56] For example, you can move an enchantment onto Deadly Insect.
E.9.Ruling.2 - Enchantments do not forget any phase costs (see Rule A.6), phase abilities (see Rule A.5), or uses that happened prior to being moved. [D'Angelo 05/04/98]
E.9.Ruling.3 - If you move an enchantment such as Firebreathing after mana has been spent to pump it up, the effects of the pumping are directly on the creature and do not move with the Firebreathing card. If you moved it after activation but before resolution, the effect will still happen to the original creature and not the new one because this is "locked in" on announcement of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
E.9.Ruling.4 - If the enchantment was targeted by a spell or ability prior to being moved, the moving will not cause the targeting to fail. It is still the same enchantment. [D'Angelo 09/26/95]
E.9.Ruling.5 - You cannot move Dance of the Dead, Animate Dead, or Necromancy to another creature or to a creature in the graveyard. These have exactly one legal target creature, the one they were cast for. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 25] [D'Angelo 06/05/97]
E.9.Ruling.6 - When the enchantment is moved, any effects on the enchantment stay on it. For example, the enchantments that play as an instant and are scheduled to be buried at end of turn will still be buried at end of turn if they are moved. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24]
E.10 - Pitch Spells
E.10.1 - 'Pitch spells' is the nickname for spells which allow you to discard cards (typically they are actually removed from the game) instead of paying the casting cost. They were introduced in Alliances. This name has also been extended to cover other non-mana ways to cast spells. For example, the Visions card Fireblast which lets you sacrifice Mountains.
E.10.2 - The non-mana cost is paid at the time you announce the spell or ability and is considered to be paying the casting cost (see Rule K.9) for you. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 55]
E.10.Ruling.1 - It does not actually change the casting cost of the spell for any reasons, including spells or abilities like Spell Blast. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]
E.10.Ruling.2 - If there is a penalty on the play cost of the spell, such as Gloom on a Scars of the Veteran, you must pay the penalty even if you use the "pitch" ability to avoid the casting cost (see Rule K.9) portion of the play cost (see Rule K.21). [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]
E.10.Ruling.3 - You cannot use Sleight of Mind to stop a "pitch" spell which requires a card of a certain color to be discarded. This is because the costs are paid prior to the Sleight being usable. See Rule T.3.1. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]
E.10.Ruling.4 - You cannot discard a spell card to pay for itself. [D'Angelo 05/28/98] See Rule T.4.4.
E.11 - Poison
E.11.1 - Poison counters are poison counters no matter what the source is.
E.11.2 - A player loses the game if they have 10 (or more) such counters at any time. This is a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13). [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]
E.11.Ruling.1 - The "lose if you have 10 poison counters" effect is built into the poison counters. You do not need a poison generating card in play for the rule to take effect. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]
E.12 - Tap and Hold Abilities
E.12.1 - Abilities for which you tap the card, and the effects last as long as the card is tapped are called 'tap and hold effects'.
E.12.2 - These abilities are duration effects. The effect lasts until the card is untapped. This is similar to a normal time duration effect such as "until end of turn", but is "until the card which generated the effect stops being tapped". [D'Angelo 09/12/95] See Rule T.2.5, Rule T.2.6, Rule T.2.7, and Rule T.2.8 for more information on duration effects.
E.12.Ruling.1 - Although these cards usually only say "as long as <-this card-> remains tapped", they also mean "and is in play". [WotC Rules Team 02/06/96] A card which is not in play cannot be still tapped.
E.12.Ruling.2 - If the card untaps before the tap and hold ability actually resolves, the tap and hold effect never takes effect at all. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] See Rule T.2.7.
E.12.Ruling.3 - The effect continues even if the card loses its abilities. It only ends if the card untaps or leaves play. [D'Angelo 09/12/95] This is possible if an artifact is animated by Titania's Song or a land changes type by Phantasmal Terrain.
E.12.Ruling.4 - If one of these cards or its target leaves play temporarily by phasing out (see Rule G.30) or otherwise leaving play, the effect will end and will not restart when it re-enters play. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]
E.13 - Templates
E.13.1 - The choice of wording on Magic cards is called templating. Here are some templates and cross-references to their related rules.
E.13.Ruling.1 - Something that affects "each X and Y" affects everything that counts as an X and/or counts as a Y. It will not affect anything twice. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]
E.13.Ruling.2 - The text "target X or target Y" is the same as "target X or Y" and is just spelled out to make the targeting more clear. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]
E.13.Ruling.3 - The text "all players", "each player", or "any player may" do something means that the ability is played by that player, but is controlled by the controller of the spell or ability which said that. See Rule A.1.8.
E.13.Ruling.4 - If a spell or ability does not specify who does something, or specifies "you", then it means the controller. See Rule A.1.9.
E.13.Ruling.5 - The text "<-cost->: <-effect->" on a permanent indicates an activated ability. See Rule A.2.1 If this text appears on an instant, sorcery or mana source, then it is part of the play cost. See Rule K.21.3.
E.13.Ruling.6 - The text "until <-something happens->", such as "until end of turn" or "until this card leaves play", indicates a duration on the effect. See Rule A.2.5.
E.13.Ruling.7 - The text "as long as <-something is true->" indicates a duration on the effect. See Rule A.2.5. It can also be used to indicate a continuous effect which is only on some of the time. See Rule A.4.2. There are some special rules on "as long as <-card-> remains tapped". See Rule E.12.
E.13.Ruling.8 - The text "No more than <-amount-> can be spent this way each turn" or "You may pay no more than <-amount-> in this way" indicates a limitation. See Rule A.2.6.
E.13.Ruling.9 - The text "Use this only <-number-> times each turn" indicates a limitation. See Rule A.2.6.
E.13.Ruling.10 - The text "At begining/end of <-phase->, do <-something->" indicates a begin/end of phase ability. See Rule A.3.1.
E.13.Ruling.11 - The text "During <-phase->, do <-something->" indicates a phase ability. See Rule A.5.1.
E.13.Ruling.12 - The text "During <-phase->, do <-something-> or else <-something happens->" and "During <-phase->, do <-something->. If you cannot, <-something happens->" indicates a phase cost. See Rule A.6.1.
E.13.Ruling.13 - The text "If/when <-something happens->, do <-something->" indicates a triggered ability. See Rule A.8.1. If the "<-something happens->" is that some card "comes into play", then also see Rule E.3.1.
E.13.Ruling.14 - The text "<-cost->: <-effect->. Use this ability only when <-something happens->" indicates an activated triggered ability. See Rule A.8.2.
E.13.Ruling.15 - The text "When <-something-> comes into play, do <-something> or do <-something else->" or "When <-something-> comes into play, do <-something->. If you cannot, do <-something else->" is a comes into play triggered ability (see Rule A.8 and Rule E.3) which acts like a phase cost (see Rule A.6). See Rule E.3.3.
E.13.Ruling.16 - The text "You may pay an additional <-cost-> during your upkeep to untap this permanent" indicates an untap cost. See Rule A.10.1.
E.13.Ruling.17 - The text "If <-this card-> attacks and is not blocked, you may do <-something->" is known as a saboteur ability. See Rule E.7.1.
E.13.Ruling.18 - The text "Do <-cost-> to do <-effect->" indicates that the first part is done as part of the cost of announcing the spell or ability. See Rule G.7.Ruling.1.
E.13.Ruling.19 - The text "Counts as a <-something->" has special rules. See Rule G.10.
E.13.Ruling.20 - The text "Do A to target X or do B to target Y" means the spell or ability is modal. See Rule G.27.2.
E.13.Ruling.21 - The text "at the end of any turn" means "at the end of every turn". [D'Angelo 06/05/98]
E.13.Ruling.22 - The text "at the time you play <-card name->, do <-something->" descibes an additional part of the cost of playing the card. This cost must be paid when announcing it. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
E.13.Ruling.23 - The text "If/when <-something happens->, do <-something> instead of <-something else->" indicates a replacement ability. See Rule A.7. Contrast this with Rule E.13.Ruling.13 which describes a triggered ability. The word "instead" is the key. [bethmo 11/03/98]
E.13.Ruling.24 - The text "...this turn" is identical to "...until end of turn". The shorter version is used when "until" would not be clear, such as with "you cannot regenerate the creature until end of turn", which some people took as a delay rather than a duration. [bethmo 03/24/99]
E.13.Ruling.25 - The text "(this still counts as a land)" means the same as "(if this was a land, it still is a land)". [bethmo 04/10/99]
E.14 - Vanguard Cards
E.14.1 - The effects of Vanguard cards are treated like the first effects in play during the game. They can be overridden by later effects, just like any other effect can. [Aahz 07/21/97]
E.14.2 - Vanguard cards are only legal if they are allowed in the given tournament format, or if not in a tournament and all player's agree to allow them.
E.14.Ruling.1 - The Barrin card does not target the creature, so untargetable creatures are not immune. [D'Angelo 01/06/98]
E.14.Ruling.2 - Crovax triggers once per player or creature successfully damaged, and not once per point of damage. [bethmo 01/07/98]
E.14.Ruling.3 - A player with Gerrard who goes first skips one draw in the first draw phase, not both of them. [Aahz 08/10/97]
E.14.Ruling.4 - Orim gives the option of blocking as if the creature had Flying. You can choose to block as if you did not have Flying. This is useful with Chaosphere. [bethmo 01/07/98]
G - Game Terms and Rules
G.1 - Activation Cost
G.1.1 - An activation cost is the cost to use an activated ability (see Rule A.2). It is always written on a card as "<-cost->: <-effect->". [Fifth Edition, Page 65]
Note - It is possible for an Instant, Interrupt, Sorcery or Mana Source card to use the "<-cost->: <-effect->" notation. When this happens it is not an activation cost. See Rule K.21.3.
Note - Also see Costs (Rule G.7).
Note - Also see Play Cost (Rule K.21).
G.2 - Bury
G.2.1 - The term "bury" means to put a card or token in its owner's graveyard. [Fifth Edition, Page 67] This usually is only done from play.
G.2.2 - A "bury" cannot be prevented by any means. [Fifth Edition, Page 67]
G.2.Ruling.1 - You may not attempt to regenerate a buried creature. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24]
Note - Also see Destroy (Rule G.14).
G.3 - Caster
G.3.1 - The caster of a spell is the one who announced the spell. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]
G.3.Ruling.1 - The caster is almost always the owner of the card, but if Grinning Totem is used, the caster may differ from the owner. [bethmo 10/14/96]
Note - Also see Controller (Rule G.6).
Note - Also see Owner (Rule G.29).
G.4 - Color
G.4.1 - Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White are the only colors in the game. [Fifth Edition, Page 67]
G.4.2 - "Colorless" means "without any color". "Colorless" is not a valid choice for a color.
G.4.Ruling.1 - Artifact is not a color, it is a characteristic.
G.4.Ruling.2 - Gold is not a color. It is just the background color used on cards which have more than one color in their casting cost. [Aahz 06/15/94]
Note - Also see Color of a Spell/Permanent (Rule K.10).
G.5 - Colorless Mana
G.5.1 - Colorless mana is mana which has no color. Some spells and abilities may generate this kind of mana. [Fifth Edition, Page 67]
Note - Also see Generic Mana (Rule G.20).
G.6 - Controller
G.6.1 - The controller of a spell or ability is the player playing the spell or ability.
G.6.2 - The controller of a permanent starts as the one who controlled the spell or ability that brought the permanent into play (unless otherwise stated in the spell or ability). [Fifth Edition, Page 15]
G.6.3 - The controller of a permanent may be changed by a spell or ability. If there are multiple control changes on a single permanent, the most recent control effect determines who controls the permanent. If an effect ends, control reverts to the next most recent control effect, or to the starting controller if there are no other control effects. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.6.4 - The text "you" or "your" on a card always refers to the controller. Similarly, use of imperative language (which means directed instructions such as "discard a card") also refers to the controller. [Fifth Edition, Page 15]
G.6.Ruling.1 - The controller of the effect of a spell or ability is the same as the controller of the spell or ability itself. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]
G.6.Ruling.2 - If a player is instructed to play a phase ability of a permanent they do not control, the controller of the permanent is still considered to be the controller of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 05/02/98] For example, Bottomless Pit.
G.6.Ruling.3 - If a triggered ability gives a player other than the controller of the source of the ability an option to do something, that player is considered to play and control that triggered ability even though they do not control the source of that ability. See Rule A.8.11. [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98] For example, Zur's Weirding.
G.6.Ruling.4 - If a triggered ability gives each player the option to do something, the controller of the source plays and controls the ability. The controller chooses what they do first, then other players do. See Rule A.8.12. [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98] For example, Noble Benefactor.
Note - Changing the controller of a permanent does not change the controller of local enchantments on that permanent. See Rule K.14.7.
G.7 - Costs
G.7.1 - A cost is something paid or done during the announcement of a spell or ability. The most common costs are mana payments, tapping a permanent (see Rule G.40), payment of life (see Rule G.22), and sacrifices (see Rule G.35), but a cost can be anything.
G.7.2 - The payment of a cost is unpreventable if you have the required resources (most often this is mana). Effects may prevent you from having the resource available. For example, the cost may be raised by Gloom or a card may not be tappable due to Volrath's Curse. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]
G.7.3 - You cannot pay a cost if you do not have the resource available.
G.7.4 - If costs combine (as with phase costs) into something that is contradictory, then you cannot pay the cost at all. [Aahz 02/16/97] For example, you cannot both sacrifice a card and send that same card to your hand.
G.7.5 - Costs cannot be modified with replacement abilities (see Rule A.7). [Aahz 06/16/97] For example, you cannot use Aladdin's Lamp on a draw from Psychic Vortex.
G.7.Ruling.1 - All cards that read "Do X to do Y" means that X is a cost and Y is an effect. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]
G.7.Ruling.2 - Once you pay a cost you cannot get it back, even if the spell or ability is countered (see Rule G.8).
G.7.Ruling.3 - You cannot pay a cost which requires a life payment if you have zero or less life or if the payment will bring you below zero life. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 22] See Rule G.7.3 and Rule G.22.6.
G.7.Ruling.4 - You cannot tap a tapped card or untap an untapped card as part of a cost. [D'Angelo 12/23/96] See Rule G.40.2 and Rule G.45.2.
G.7.Ruling.5 - Since each spell or ability is announced separately, and each cost is paid with each announcement, a single resource cannot be used to pay multiple costs. For example, you cannot sacrifice one creature to pay two sacrifice costs, and you cannot cast two spells using the same point of mana. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.7.Ruling.6 - A cost cannot be paid accidentally. It can only be paid during the announcement of a spell or ability. For example, you cannot cause a Prodigal Sorcerer to deal damage by making it become tapped. You must actually announce the use of its ability and tap it during that announcement as part of the cost in order to make it deal damage.
Note - Also see Activation Cost (Rule G.1).
Note - Also see Casting Cost (Rule K.9).
Note - Also see Play Cost (Rule K.21).
G.8 - Countering Spells and Abilities
G.8.1 - A spell or ability may be countered during the interrupt part of its life cycle. [Fifth Edition, Page 42] See Rule T.5.
G.8.2 - When a spell is countered, it is placed in its owner's graveyard. The spell is cancelled. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
G.8.3 - When an ability is countered, all of its effects are cancelled.
G.8.4 - Once a spell or ability is countered, it is an illegal target for interrupts. Any unresolved interrupts which target the spell will fizzle when they resolve. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
G.8.Ruling.1 - Costs (see Rule G.7) paid when playing the spell or ability are lost. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
G.8.Ruling.2 - The spell or ability is not considered "successfully cast" or "successfully played" (see Rule T.5) and none of its effects will take place. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
Note - Spells (see Rule K.3) and abilities (see Rule A.1) are different things, and counterspells usually work on one or the other. For example, a Power Sink counters a spell so cannot target a Prodigal Sorcerer's ability.
G.9 - Counters
G.9.1 - Counters are used to keep track of long-term changes to a permanent. [Fifth Edition, Page 32]
G.9.2 - Counters of the same name are interchangeable. For example, Poison counters from all sources are still Poison counters. [Fifth Edition, Page 32]
G.9.3 - Counters with just a value, such as +1/+1, are interchangeable with other counters with exactly the same value. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] For example, a Spike Drone can move its counter onto a Tetravus and the Tetravus could use the counter.
G.9.4 - Counters are considered to apply themselves to the permanent just after any built-in abilities of that permanent, but before any other effects are applied. [Aahz 09/28/97]
G.9.5 - Counters remain on a permanent even if they currently do not apply. [Mirage, Page 25] For example, if a Mishra's Factory gets a +1/+1 counter while it is a creature, the counter will remain when it turns back into a land, and it will still be there if it later turns back into a creature. Similarly, a Licid will keep a +1/+1 counter even while it is in enchantment form.
G.9.Ruling.1 - Counters are interchangeable even if the card says "these counters" on it. [WotC Rules Team 03/01/98]
Note - Also see Token Creatures, Rule K.25.
G.10 - Counts As
G.10.1 - If a card "Counts as <-something->" then the card is in all ways a <-something->. For example, Wall of Spears is a Wall because it says "Counts as a wall" in its text.
G.10.2 - Counts as text applies no matter what zone (see Rule Z.1) the card is in.
G.10.3 - Counts as text is not considered an ability.
G.11 - Damage
G.11.1 - Damage done to a player results in an equivalent loss of life (see Rule G.24). [Fifth Edition, Page 19]
G.11.2 - Damage done to a creature remains on that creature until the end of turn (actually the Cleanup phase, see Rule P.10). [Fifth Edition, Page 19]
G.11.3 - Damage is not removed if a permanent stops being a creature. The damage will be there if it becomes a creature again later in the same turn. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]
G.11.4 - Damage is removed from a permanent as soon as it leaves play. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]
G.11.5 - Each point of damage remembers all the characteristics (see Rule K.4) of the source of that damage. This includes, the color, creature type, and any special abilities associated with the damage. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97]
G.11.Ruling.1 - Damage does not arrive in "packets". Instead each point of damage has all the characteristics of the source associated with it. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97]
G.11.Ruling.2 - If you get to choose how damage is to be distributed among multiple permanents or players, then you can only distribute whole number values, and you cannot choose zero. If a spell or ability lets you choose how much total damage is dealt, you can choose zero. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]
Note - Also see Damage Prevention, Rule G.12.
Note - Also see Damage Redirection, Rule G.13.
Note - Also see Creature Power and Toughness, Rule K.12.
Note - Damage is "combat damage" only if it is done during the damage dealing part of the attack phase. See Rule C.8.1.
Note - A creature has "lethal damage" if it has as much damage on it as it has toughness. See Rule K.12.4.
Note - Damage can only be assigned to a creature or player. If a spell or ability resolves to find that a permanent it was going to damage is no longer a creature, then it will not assign damage to it. See Rule T.10.7.
Note - See Rule A.8.9 and A.8.10 for information on how effects that trigger on damage being assigned or dealt are handled.
G.12 - Damage Prevention
G.12.1 - Spells and abilities which prevent damage can only be played during a Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10). [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
G.12.2 - Damage prevention spells and abilities can only be played if there is damage to prevent. They can be played if they prevent more damage than there is, but they cannot be played if there is zero damage (even if you have a spell that can prevent zero damage). [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.12.3 - If the spell or ability prevents a specific amount of damage, you choose which of the points of damage you want to prevent. If the spell restricts your choice, such as to just damage from a single source, you must follow that restriction. This choice is made when announcing the damage prevention spell or ability. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.12.4 - If the spell or ability prevents all damage, or all damage which meets a given restriction, then the spell or ability will affect all the damage if finds upon its resolution. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.12.5 - Normally, damage cannot be prevented after it has been successfully "dealt" at the end of a Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10), but a couple of spells may "retroactively" prevent damage. For example, Reverse Damage may be played later in the turn, whereas most damage prevention can only be played during the particular Damage Prevention Step associated with that damage.
G.12.6 - When damage is "retroactively" prevented, it does not undo any side-effects of that damage being "dealt". See Rule T.10.1. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]
G.12.Ruling.1 - If damage is prevented, it is never considered "dealt", so any side-effects of that damage will also be prevented. See Rule T.10.6.
G.12.Ruling.2 - Damage prevention spells and abilities do not target damage. They just target what the card says they target. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.12.Ruling.3 - Because of rule G.12.3, if you take damage multiple times from the same source during a single Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10), then a single use of a Circle of Protection can prevent all the damage from that source. For example, if the red card Manabarbs is in play and you tap for mana during a Damage Prevention Step, the damage is added to the current Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10.10) and since it is all from the same red source a single use of Circle of Protection: Red will prevent all of that damage. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
G.12.Ruling.4 - If a damage prevention spell or ability has a target and you change that target, then the damage prevention spell may not do anything. If it prevents all damage to the target, it will work normally, but if it prevents a certain amount of damage it will not prevent anything on the new target since the damage chosen on announcing the spell is not actually on the new target creature. [bethmo 03/11/98]
G.12.Ruling.5 - Triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) which prevent damage, such as Protection from Color (see Rule A.24), are not considered damage prevention abilities even though they follow the rules for damage prevention. They are considered triggered abilities. Therefore, effects which disallow the use of damage prevention will not stop these triggers from preventing damage. [bethmo 03/27/98]
Note - Also see Damage, Rule G.11.
Note - Also see Damage Redirection, Rule G.13.
Note - Also see Damage Prevention Step, Rule T.10.
G.13 - Damage Redirection
G.13.1 - A spell or ability may cause damage to be "redirected" from a creature or player to another creature or player.
G.13.2 - Spells and abilities which redirect damage can only be played during a Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10). [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
G.13.3 - Damage redirection spells and abilities can only be played if there is damage to redirect. They can be played if they redirect more damage than there is, but they cannot be played if there is zero damage (even if you have a spell that can redirect zero damage). [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.13.4 - If the spell or ability redirects a specific amount of damage, you choose which of the points of damage you want to redirect. If the spell restricts your choice, such as to just damage from a single source, you must follow that restriction. This choice is made when announcing the damage redirection spell or ability. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.13.5 - If the spell or ability redirects all damage, or all damage which meets a given restriction, then the spell or ability will affect all the damage if finds upon its resolution. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.13.6 - Redirected damage maintains all of its characteristics (see Rule K.4). For example, it maintains its color and side-effects. [Fifth Edition, Page 51]
G.13.7 - Redirected damage is considered to come from its original source. It does not come from the spell or source of the ability that redirected the damage. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 37]
G.13.8 - Redirecting damage causes it to stop being "combat damage" (see Rule C.8.1). [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
G.13.9 - Redirecting damage counts as preventing damage on the original creature or player, and assigning damage to the new creature or player. This means that abilities which trigger (see Rule A.8) on damage being "assigned" will trigger when the damage is redirected. [WotC Rules Team 12/18/97] For example, Furnace of Rath triggers and doubles damage whenever you redirect the damage.
G.13.10 - Normally, damage cannot be redirected after it has been successfully "dealt" at the end of a Damage Prevention Step (see Rule T.10), but a couple of spells may "retroactively" redirect damage. For example, Simulacrum may be played later in the turn, whereas most damage redirection can only be played during the particular Damage Prevention Step associated with that damage.
G.13.11 - When damage is "retroactively" redirected, then the damage remembers its characteristics, but not any abilities associated with the damage. For example, a Hypnotic Specter's retroactively redirected damage will not cause a player to discard a card. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]
G.13.Ruling.1 - You can redirect damage from a creature or player to that same creature or player. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97] This makes it possible to keep damage on the same creature, but make it stop being "combat damage" because it was redirected (see Rule G.13.8). [Aahz 06/06/97]
G.13.Ruling.2 - Triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) which redirect damage, are not considered damage redirection abilities even though they follow the rules for damage redirection. They are considered triggered abilities. Therefore, effects which disallow the use of damage redirection will not stop these triggers from redirecting damage. [Aahz 11/07/97] For example, Whippoorwill will not stop such damage.
Note - Also see Damage, Rule G.11.
Note - Also see Damage Prevention, Rule G.12.
Note - Also see Damage Prevention Step, Rule T.10.
G.14 - Destroy
G.14.1 - To "destroy" a permanent (see Rule K.2) is to place it into its owner's graveyard from play. [Fifth Edition, Page 68]
G.14.2 - A creature can regenerate (see Rule G.32) if it is destroyed.
Note - Also see Bury, Rule G.2.
Note - All cards printed prior to Mirage that say they destroy themselves now have errata to say that they bury themselves. For example, Dragon Whelp buries itself it pumped up too much. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]
G.15 - Discard
G.15.1 - To "discard" a card is to place it into your graveyard from your hand. [Fifth Edition, Page 68]
G.15.2 - If you have to discard more than one card in a single effect, all the cards are chosen and discarded at one time (unless otherwise noted on the card). [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 55] You decide the order the cards get stacked in the graveyard (see Rule Z.3.3).
G.15.Ruling.1 - You cannot discard a card just because you want to. You can only discard if a game rule or spell or ability tells you to do so.
G.15.Ruling.2 - A spell or ability may have you put a card from your hand into the graveyard. This is not a discard unless the word "discard" is used in the spell or ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 58]
G.15.Ruling.3 - If you are asked to discard, and it does not specify how the card to discard is chosen, then the affected player chooses. [Mirage, Page 54]
G.15.Ruling.4 - A discard is not forced if it is done as part of a cost, and it is forced if it is done as part of an effect. [D'Angelo 06/11/97]
G.15.Ruling.5 - A discard done as part of an effect is forced even if you have the option of doing something to avoid the discard. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 26]
Note - Some older cards used the word "discard" when talking about cards in play. All such cards have errata to change the word to "destroy" or to "sacrifice". [WotC Rules Team 01/29/95]
Note - See Rule A.8.9 and Rule A.8.10 for how abilities which trigger on cards being discarded are handled.
G.16 - Draw
G.16.1 - When asked to "draw" a card, you take the top card from your library (see Rule Z.5) and put it into your hand. [Fifth Edition, Page 68]
G.16.Ruling.1 - An effect is a draw only if it says so. Being told to take a card from your library and put it in your hand is not a draw. [Fifth Edition, Page 58]
G.16.Ruling.2 - If you are required to draw more than one card due to a single action, all the draws happen at once. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 55]
G.16.Ruling.3 - Replacement abilities (see Rule A.7) which replace a single draw may be played on a multiple card draw. The replacement effect happens prior to drawing the un-replaced cards. [D'Angelo 06/11/97]
Note - See Rule A.8.9 and A.8.10 for information on how effects that trigger on draws are handled.
Note - A player loses the game (see Rule G.23) immediately if they have to draw a card and their library is empty. See Rule Z.5.7.
G.17 - Exchange
G.17.1 - A spell or ability may ask you to exchange control of permanents with an opponent. This means to give them control of the specified permanents you control and take control of the specified permanents they control. [Mirage, Page 29]
G.17.2 - The exchange effect fails to do anything if there were permanents chosen during announcement, and those permanents are not still available for exchange and under the same player's control during resolution. [Mirage, Page 29]
G.17.3 - An exchange with a card in the graveyard puts the card that was in play into its owner's graveyard, regardless of whose graveyard the card is taken out of. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] See Goblin Welder. And the card goes on top of the gravyard, not into the middle of it.
G.18 - Fast Effect
G.18.1 - Fast effects are spells and abilities played as Instants, Interrupts, and Mana Sources. [Fifth Edition, Page 22]
Note - Many people use this term as slang to mean "instant speed spells and abilities".
Note - This term is being eliminated from the game, so you should probably avoid using it.
G.19 - Fizzle
G.19.1 - The term "fizzle" is used to indicate a spell or ability failed to resolve because it target is illegal (or not present) on resolution. A spell or ability which is not targeted cannot fizzle. [Fifth Edition, Page 69]
G.19.Ruling.1 - A spell or ability may fail to do anything useful for a number of reasons. You should not say that a failed spell "fizzles".
Note - See Targeting, Rule G.41.4, for more information.
Note - Spells which fizzle are still considered "successfully cast" even though they have no effect. See Rule T.7.2. [bethmo 05/30/94]
G.20 - Generic Mana
G.20.1 - The term "generic mana" means "mana of any color or mana which is colorless". For example, a spell which requires 2 generic mana and one green mana may be cast using 1 colorless mana, 1 red mana, and one green mana. [Fifth Edition, Page 69]
G.20.2 - Generic mana is depicted on cards using a gray circle with a number in it. [Fifth Edition, Page 69]
G.20.3 - A generic mana X is still considered to be generic even if there is a requirement in the card text to only spend a certain color of mana on it. This distinction allows effects which reduce the generic mana cost of an ability to reduce the amount needed to pay for X. For example, if you have two Helm of Awakenings in play (each reduces the generic costs of spells by 1), you could cast a Fifth Edition Drain Life for just B and still do 1 damage. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97] [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 26]
G.20.Ruling.1 - You can never have generic mana in your mana pool. Generic mana only appears in the cost of spells and abilities. It indicates a freedom to apply any colored or colorless mana to that cost. [D'Angelo 05/28/98]
G.20.Ruling.2 - A few older cards used the generic mana symbol when they talk about mana they generate. All such cards have errata to say they generate colorless mana instead of using that symbol. [D'Angelo 05/28/98]
Note - Mana people use the term "colorless mana" when talking about mana in the gray circle. This is not accurate. They should say "generic mana".
Note - Also see Colorless Mana, Rule G.5.
G.21 - Infinity
G.21.1 - There is no such thing as "infinity" in Magic. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
G.21.2 - If a combination occurs which is completely under player control, it could potentially be repeated an infinite number of times. If this happens, the player should demonstrate the cycle a few times, then state how many times they want to do this. This must be a positive, finite integer. If the opponent does nothing to interfere, then the actions occur the stated number of times. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] Any player may say that after some smaller number of times they want to stop the loop to take some action (which is legal at that time). This causes the additional loops to not happen, but does not stop the player from starting the loop again if they can. [D'Angelo 04/16/98]
G.21.3 - If a loop occurs for which the players have no control, first demonstrate the cycle a few times. Then each player picks a number, which must be a finite positive integer. The active player picks first. The loop repeats for a number of times equal to the larger of the numbers chosen. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] If a player has a way to legally do something during the loop, they can stop the loop after any smaller number of times in order to do their action. This causes the additional loops to not happen, but does not stop the loop from starting again if it can. [D'Angelo 04/16/98]
G.21.4 - For loops not under player control, cards remain where they would be at the end of the loop. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] These kinds of loops only happen when they consist entirely of triggered and/or scheduled abilities, so the loop is considered to start with the first triggered or scheduled ability that ends up being part of the loop as demonstrated. [D'Angelo 04/16/98]
G.21.Ruling.1 - The phrase "end of the loop" is used here to mean the same as "the state just before the loop would begin again".
G.21.Ruling.2 - If an Ivory Gargoyle comes into play at end of turn and an AEther Flash is in play, a loop will start. In this case, the Gargoyle enters play, dies, enters play, dies, ... The end condition is the end of a loop, which means it ends when the Gargoyle dies so it stays in the graveyard. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
G.21.Ruling.3 - Sacred Ground is in play under one player's control and Land Equilibrium is under another player's control. When a player puts a land into play, it triggers a cycle of sacrifice a land, put it back into play, sacrifice a land, put it back into play... The end condition is that the land ends up in play. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
G.21.Ruling.4 - You cannot use the "pick a number" rule (Rule G.21.3) for loops which are not really infinite. If a loop will end, the game will run it to completion. [bethmo 11/03/98]
Note - There is no ruling for loops where a loop consists of player actions, but there is an element of randomness involved, such as coin flipping or deck shuffling. If a player wants to repeat until a certain condition occurs, the result will be up to the judge at any particular tournament. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
G.22 - Life
G.22.1 - Each player starts the game with 20 life points. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.2 - A player may gain life points to have a higher total during the game. There is no upper limit. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.3 - A player loses the game if they have less than 1 life at the end of any phase (see Rule P.3.1) or the beginning or end of an attack (see Rule C.3.1 and Rule C.9.2). [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.4 - All players are entitled to know each other's life totals at all times.
G.22.5 - A spell or ability may reduce a player to less than zero life by means of damage or loss of life. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.6 - If a spell or ability allows you to pay life points to get some effect, you cannot pay more life points than you have. If you already have zero or less life points, you may not pay for any spell or ability which requires a payment or 1 or more life points. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.7 - A player at zero or less life is treated as having zero life for all reasons other than raising their life total. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.22.Ruling.1 - Because of Rule G.22.7, if you are instructed to lose a fraction of your life points while you are already below zero life, your life total does not change. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
Note - Also see Loss of Life, Rule G.24.
G.23 - Losing the Game
G.23.1 - If both players lose the game at the same time or during the resolution of a single part/event of a spell or ability, then they both lose. It does not matter if one player has a more negative life total. [Fifth Edition, Page 57]
G.23.2 - Cards in the game may add additional ways for a player to lose the game. [Fifth Edition, Page 58]
G.23.3 - A player may concede the game at any time. Nothing can be done to respond to this. The game is simply over and they lost. [Fifth Edition, Page 58]
G.23.Ruling.1 - You check for players losing the game, due to any effect other than having zero of less life, whenever a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13) would get checked for. This means it happens only after fully resolving a spell or ability (or at an appropriate splitting point, see Rule T.7.1). For example, if Wheel of Fortune is cast and neither player has enough cards in their library, they both lose. It is not the first one to draw that loses. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123] [bethmo 02/07/98] This most often only applies to draw effects since that is one of the few ways to lose because of an effect.
G.23.Ruling.2 - If both players want to concede (for some odd reason) and they cannot agree on who conceded first, then the duel is a draw. [Oracle 07/01/98]
Note - A player loses the game if their life total is zero or less at the end of a phase or the beginning or end of an attack. See Rule G.22.3.
Note - A player loses the game immediately if they have to draw a card and their library is empty. See Rule Z.5.7.
Note - A player loses the game immediately if they have 10 or more Poison counters. See Rule E.11.
G.24 - Loss of Life
G.24.1 - Loss of life can happen because a spell or ability instructs a player to lose life, or because damage dealt to the player is not prevented.
G.24.2 - There is no way to prevent or redirect the loss of life caused directly by spells and abilities. Only damage can be prevented. [Fifth Edition, Page 57] Many cards say this as reminder text, but it is true even if they do not.
G.24.Ruling.1 - Abilities that trigger on the loss of life also trigger when you pay life points for something. [WotC Rules Team 02/06/96]
Note - Only players have life points. Creatures do not.
G.25 - Mana Burn
G.25.1 - If you have any mana in your mana pool at the end of a phase (see Rule P.3.1) or at the beginning or end of an attack (see Rule C.3.1 and Rule C.9.2), then you lose 1 life for each point of mana in your mana pool. [Fifth Edition, Page 70]
G.25.2 - Mana burn is a single action which uses all the mana in your pool. You cannot choose to take some of your mana as mana burn and use the rest to power some effect that triggers on loss of life. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.26 - Mana Pool
G.26.1 - The mana pool is a place where you temporarily store mana between getting it and spending it. When you use a mana source spell or ability, it adds mana to your mana pool. When you announce a spell or ability which has a mana cost, you pay mana from your mana pool. [Fifth Edition, Page 70]
G.26.Ruling.1 - You can leave mana in your mana pool between the casting of several spells. The mana pool is only emptied by you spending the mana, by Mana Burn (see Rule G.25), or by a spell or ability which instructs you to do so.
G.26.Ruling.2 - You do not cast spells by tapping lands. You cast spells by tapping lands for mana, and putting this mana into your mana pool. Then you spend the mana from the mana pool.
Note - Tapping basic lands is the most common way to add mana to your mana pool.
Note - Also see Mana Burn, Rule G.25.
G.27 - Modal Spells and Abilities
G.27.1 - Some spells and abilities require a choice as to which mode they operate in. This choice is a casting/playing decision made on announcement. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50] For example, Red Elemental Blast can counter a spell or destroy a permanent. You choose which mode it is in when you announce the spell.
G.27.2 - Cards worded as "Do A to target X or do B to target Y" or as "Do A or do B to target X" are modal. They require you to choose which of the two options is being used. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50]
G.27.3 - Cards worded as "Do A to target X, Y, or Z" are not modal. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50] For example, Enervate is not modal. This means that whether the target is an artifact, creature, or land is not chosen when announcing Enervate.
G.27.4 - If a spell or ability is used to change the target of a modal spell or ability, they cannot change the mode. This may restrict what kinds of targets are legal for the new target. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]
G.27.5 - If a spell is modal and has different kinds of targets depending on the mode, you choose the mode before picking targets, and you do not pick targets for the unused mode(s). [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
G.27.6 - If the opponent gets to pick the mode, the caster must make all choices before knowing the mode. This means, the caster may have to pick targets which won't actually be targeted upon resolution. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
G.27.7 - Some spells and abilities are considered modal even though the choice is not up to the player. For example, Gangrenous Zombies has two modes: "deal 1 damage" and "deal 2 damage". The mode is locked in on announcement and is not changed later even if the lands you control changes. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]
G.27.8 - Newer modal spells and abilities use the format "Choose One - A; or B; or C." [D'Angelo 02/13/99]
G.27.Ruling.1 - It can sometimes be difficult to determine if a spell or ability is modal. In general, if it does more than one kind of effect then it is probably modal.
G.28 - On Its Way to the Graveyard
G.28.Ruling.1 - This term is no longer in use. There is no such thing as a card "on its way to the graveyard".
G.29 - Owner
G.29.1 - The owner of a card is the one who started the game with that card in their library (see Rule Z.5). [Fifth Edition, Page 71] Note that the game does not care who has property ownership of the cards, just who started the game with them.
G.29.2 - The owner of a token creature (see Rule K.25) is the controller of the spell or ability that put the token into play. [Fifth Edition, Page 32]
G.29.3 - Ownership of a card changes only when a card specifically states that it does.
Note - Cards which go to the graveyard, a player's hand, or a player's library always go to their owner's location, regardless of who currently controls the card. See Rule Z.1.5.
G.30 - Phasing Out and In
G.30.1 - When a permanent "phases out", it goes to the Phased Out zone (see Rule Z.8). Phased out permanents are not in play and cannot be affected by any spell or ability which does not explicitly say it affects phased out cards. [Mirage, Page 1]
G.30.2 - When a permanent "phases out", all abilities will trigger which would trigger on that permanent leaving play. [D'Angelo 07/03/97]
G.30.3 - When a permanent "phases out", all local enchantments on it are also phased out with it. [Mirage, Page 1]
G.30.4 - When a permanent "phases out", it keeps any counters or permanent effects on it. All temporary effects (ones that only last until some time or some condition is met, such as a "until end of turn" or "as long as <-something-> is tapped", and ones that are to happen at some time in the future, such as "at end of turn") are cancelled and never happen. Also, all damage is removed from the permanent. [Mirage, Page 1]
G.30.5 - A permanent which is "phased out" will automatically "phase in" at the beginning of your next untap phase (see Rule P.5). [Mirage, Page 1] They do not have to have Phasing ability (see Rule A.23) to phase in.
G.30.6 - Any permanents phasing out at the beginning of the untap phase because they have the Phasing (see Rule A.23) ability will phase out at the exact same time that "phased out" permanents will be phasing in. There is no time when both sets of permanents are in play. [bethmo 09/19/96]
G.30.7 - Permanents "phase in" in the same tap/untap state they were when they phased out. [Mirage, Page 2]
G.30.8 - Permanents "phase in" without summoning sickness. [Mirage, Page 2]
G.30.9 - Any abilities which would trigger when the permanent "comes into play" will _NOT_ trigger when it "phases in". [Mirage, Page 2] This is a special and important rule about Phasing that may not seem like common sense. It is nonetheless a rule.
G.30.10 - Any effects which modify how a permanent "comes into play", such as Kismet, will _NOT_ affect a card "phasing in". [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]
G.30.11 - Rule Effects (see Rule T.13) are applied when a card "phases in". So if a Legend phases in to find another already there, it will bury itself (see Rule K.19.1). And if a permanent phases in with zero toughness it will be buried due to "lethal damage" (see Rule K.12.4). [Aahz 08/18/97]
G.30.12 - If a permanent "phased out" under your control, but it was only under your control due to a temporary effect (see Rule G.30.4), then it will phase in at the start of your next untap phase, but it will phase in under it actual controller's control. [bethmo 10/03/96]
G.30.13 - Permanents remember their history when they phase in. For example, a The Fallen remembers who it has damaged, and a Safe Haven will not forget which creatures it has set aside. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24]
G.30.14 - Enchantments on a permanent "phase in" when the permanent phases in, but if the permanent never phases in, the enchantments do not return either. For example, a token creature with enchantments on it that phases out will leave the game and will never phase in, so its enchantments stay out of play. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
G.30.Ruling.1 - A token creature that "phases out" is removed from the game. See Rule K.25.6.
G.30.Ruling.2 - Cumulative upkeep (see Rule A.14) is not reset or increased while the permanent is phased out. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]
G.30.Ruling.3 - When a permanent "phases in", its effects are considered to be the newest ones for the order in which to apply effects. [Aahz 11/08/96]
Note - Also see the Phasing ability, Rule A.23.
Note - If more than one card phases in at a single time, you may need to determine the order in which their effects enter play. See Rule G.36.3.
G.31 - Put Into Play
G.31.1 - A spell or ability may instruct you to put a card into play. This is not considered to be "playing" or "casting" that card for any reason. You do not pay any costs which are paid when playing the card. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.31.2 - When putting a card into play, any X on the card is zero. [D'Angelo 12/29/97]
G.31.3 - When putting a card into play which has undefined characteristics, you must do what is required to define them. For example, a Clone requires a target creature to copy, and Minion of the Wastes requires a payment of life. You take these defining actions during the resolution of the spell or ability which is putting the card into play. This kind of action is usually denoted on the card by the text "When you play <-this card->, do <-something->", where the something is an action to define a characteristic. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
G.31.4 - If a card requires a target when played, and that card is put into play without playing it, then you must choose a target at the time it is put into play. [Aahz 02/16/97] If there is no legal target, then the card stays where it is and does not get put into play. [bethmo 05/02/98] For example, Clone requires a choice of a target creature just before it enters play. And if there is no creature to target it cannot come into play.
G.32 - Regeneration
G.32.1 - Regeneration is a means of preventing a creature from going to the graveyard due to "lethal damage" (see Rule K.12.4) or due to being destroyed (see Rule G.14). [Fifth Edition, Page 19]
G.32.2 - Regeneration is a replacement ability (see Rule A.7), and is therefore played just prior to the resolution of a destroy effect, or just after "lethal damage" is dealt to a creature. Once a creature actually does go to the graveyard, regeneration cannot be used.
G.32.3 - When a creature regenerates, all damage on it is removed, and the creature becomes tapped if it was not already tapped. [Fifth Edition, Page 20]
G.32.4 - You may not attempt to regenerate a creature which has been buried (see Rule G.2) or sacrificed (see Rule G.35). [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
G.32.Ruling.1 - Since tapping the creature is a side-effect of regeneration and not a cost (see Rule G.32.3), you can regenerate a tapped creature.
G.32.Ruling.2 - Since regeneration actually prevents the creature from going to the graveyard, it keeps all of its local enchantments and any effects that are on it. The creature will also fail to trigger any abilities that trigger on a creature going to the graveyard. [Fifth Edition, Page 20]
G.32.Ruling.3 - You may attempt to regenerate a creature which "cannot regenerate" due to an effect such as Bone Shaman. The attempt fails and none of the effects of regeneration happen. [WotC Rules Team 12/18/97]
G.32.Ruling.4 - Since it is a replacement ability (see Rule G.32.2 and Rule G.32.3), Regeneration spells and abilities can only be played when there is an actual creature death to be affected. They cannot be played if no creature is dying. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
G.32.Ruling.5 - Regeneration does not replace any other parts of the effect. It just replaces the one part of the effect which was destroying the creature that is being regenerated. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
G.32.Ruling.6 - If a single effect somehow would destroy the same creature twice, then one use of regeneration only stops one of the two destructions and a second use of regeneration would have to be done if you wanted to save the creature. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] You choose which of the destructions when the regeneration ability is played. [Aahz 09/18/97]
G.32.Ruling.7 - If more than one creature is being destroyed by a single effect, regenerating one of them removes it from the current destruction but does not remove any of the others. This is true even if the act of regenerating one causes another one to have its toughness raised so it would not have died. In other words, once a creature is dying, it can only be saved by actually regenerating that particular creature. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]
G.32.Ruling.8 - If by some chance a regeneration resolves when the creature is not dying, the spell "fails" but does not fizzle. For example, if your Debt of Loyalty on your opponent's creature is Forked to point at the same creature, the Forked one regenerates it and causes the control effect, then your spell resolves and fails to regenerate, but it still gives you control of the creature. [bethmo 06/20/97]
G.32.Ruling.9 - A regeneration spell or ability can be redirected to target a creature which is not dying. Deflection for example could redirect Death Ward to a creature which is not dying. [Aahz 09/09/97]
G.32.Ruling.10 - If a regeneration ability is countered, you cannot use that same ability again for that creature's death, but you can use other regeneration spells or abilities. See Rule T.9.3. For example, if a Clay Statue's built-in regeneration is Rusted, you cannot use its built in ability again, but you can use Death Ward. [Aahz 07/03/97]
Note - When a creature regenerates during combat, it is removed from the combat. See Rule C.1.6.
G.33 - Remove from the Game
G.33.1 - A card or token which is "removed from the game" is put into the Out of Game zone (see Rule Z.7).
G.33.Ruling.1 - You cannot regenerate (see Rule G.32) a creature which is removed from the game.
Note - Local enchantments on the permanent are put into the graveyard. See Rule K.14.4.
G.34 - Rounding
G.34.1 - If the result of a division is even (meaning it has no fractional part), then rounding up or down does not change the number.
G.34.2 - To "round down" means to drop the fractional part after dividing. For example, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. Rounding down gives you 4.
G.34.3 - To "round up" means that if the result of the division has a fractional part, choose the next higher number. For example, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. Rounding up gives you 5.
G.35 - Sacrifice
G.35.1 - A sacrifice means to put a permanent from play into its owner's graveyard. [Fifth Edition, Page 72]
G.35.2 - Sacrifices cannot be prevented by any means. [Fifth Edition, Page 33]
G.35.3 - You can only sacrifice a permanent you control. [Fifth Edition, Page 33]
G.35.4 - You choose what to sacrifice at the time you sacrifice it. Sacrifices are usually done as a cost during the announcing of a spell or ability. If the sacrifice instead happens during resolution, you choose the thing to sacrifice at that time. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] If a spell has you choose what not to sacrifice, such as with Cataclysm, you also make that choice at the time you would do the sacrifices. [WotC Rules Team 08/01/98]
G.35.5 - Sacrifices are never targeted. [bethmo 10/03/96] So Protection from Color (see Rule A.24) will not protect a creature from being sacrificed.
G.35.Ruling.1 - Sacrificing is not done at any particular speed. To determine if it is legal to sacrifice something at a given time, it is legal only if the spell or ability which requires the sacrifice is legal at that time. [D'Angelo 02/03/98] For example, the Altar of Dementia has an ability that is played as an instant. So it is legal to sacrifice a creature to it when instants are legal. Since instants like this are not legal during the Damage Prevention Step, you cannot use this ability at that time.
G.35.Ruling.2 - Sacrificing as a cost works just like spending mana. You cannot spend the same permanent to satisfy two spells or abilities that require sacrifices, just like you cannot spend a single mana point to cast two spells. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.35.Ruling.3 - You cannot sacrifice something unless a spell or ability instructs you to do so. In other words, you cannot just remove something from play because you want to. [D'Angelo 11/14/97]
G.35.Ruling.4 - When a sacrifice is done as a cost (see Rule G.7.2), then it is in the graveyard before interrupts can be used (see Rule T.5). This means that if the spell or ability is countered, you do not get the sacrificed permanent back. [Mirage, Page 26]
G.35.Ruling.5 - A permanent can sacrifice itself to one of its own abilities, unless otherwise prevented by the card text or some effect. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]
G.35.Ruling.6 - You can sacrifice something that is tapped or that has summoning sickness (see Rule G.39) since it just entered play. [D'Angelo 07/05/98]
G.35.Ruling.7 - If the cost of some ability requires you to sacrifice something you don't control, then you cannot pay the cost. See Rule G.35.3. For example, if Betrothed of Fire is on a creature you do not control, then you cannot play that ability. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
Note - You may not even attempt to regenerate a sacrificed creature. See Rule G.32.4.
Note - Some older cards had you sacrifice a card in your hand. All such cards have errata changing these sacrifices into discards. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]
Note - Many older cards which used "choose one of your artifacts and put it in the graveyard" or cards which destroyed themselves have errata to instead act as sacrifices. See individual card rulings for details.
G.36 - Simultaneous
G.36.1 - Occasionally, the game has something occur simultaneously. This means it is an "indivisible and unordered action".
G.36.2 - If something is to be done simultaneously with something else and both things have decisions to be made, all decisions are made before you do anything. Then you do all the simultaneous actions. For example, untapping cards during untap is simultaneous, but you might have to decide what to untap. If so, you decide before you untap anything. [D'Angelo 08/01/96]
G.36.3 - If more than one permanent enters play simultaneously, then the order in which the effects of those cards enter play needs to be determined. This most commonly occurs when cards "phase in" (see Rule G.30.5). The ordering follows these rules: a) The active player decides the ordering among all cards which are not local enchantments. b) If cards have local enchantments on them, the effects of local enchantments on a card enter play after that card's effects, but prior to any other card's effects. c) If there are multiple local enchantments on a card, then the effects of those local enchantments enter play in the order in which those enchantments originally entered play. [Aahz 12/04/96] For example, a Sandbar Crocodile is phased out with Flight and Earthbind on it (cast in that order). Feedback is on the Flight. When it phases in, the Crocodile's effects are considered to enter play first, then Flight's effect, then Feedback's effect (since it is on the Flight), then Earthbind's effect.
Note - See Rule Z.3.3 for information on simultaneous placement in the graveyard.
Note - See Rule Z.5.5 for information on simultaneous placement in the library.
G.37 - Skipping a Draw:
G.37.1 - A spell or ability which has you skip a draw is a replacement ability (see Rule A.7). It can only be played at the time a draw is about to be made. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.38 - Skipping a Phase
G.38.1 - If a spell or ability has you skip a phase as a cost, then the spell or ability can only be spent on that turn, prior to the phase starting. And that phase can only be "spent" once. [Mirage, Page 58]
G.38.2 - If a spell or ability has you skip a phase as an one-shot effect, then multiple phase skips can accumulate. This is usually a result of an instant or sorcery spell or ability. The phase skipping is done as an automatic phase skipping. [D'Angelo 03/03/98]
G.38.3 - If a spell or ability has you skip a phase as a continuous effect, then the phase is skipped right as you would be about to start it. This is called automatic phase skipping. [Duelist Magazine, Page 26] For example, Necropotence has you skip your draw phase as a continuous effect. [Mirage, Page 58]
G.38.4 - If there is more than one effect requiring you to skip a phase, you choose which one actually causes the phase to be skipped. For example, if you have accumulated some draw phase skips from Ivory Gargoyle (see Rule G.38.2), you can choose to have its effect skip the phase even though you have Necropotence in play. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 26]
G.38.Ruling.1 - If a phase is skipped, nothing that would happen in that phase happens. For example, if you skip your draw phase you do not get to draw a card. And if you skip your discard phase you do not have to discard down to 7 cards. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.38.Ruling.2 - Because automatic phase skipping (see Rule G.38.3) happens right as the phase starts, you can spend that phase as a cost (see Rule G.38.1) prior to the automatic phase skipping effect getting a chance at it. [Mirage, Page 58]
G.38.Ruling.3 - If an effect says to skip your next Xxxx phase, it means the next one you are about to start. It does not look into the future and pick a specific one. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]
G.38.Ruling.4 - If an effect has you skip a phase, but you have already started that phase, it does not affect the current phase. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]
G.39 - Summoning Sickness
G.39.1 - All permanents have "summoning sickness" from the time they enter play (or otherwise come under your control), until they start your turn in play under your control. [Fifth Edition, Page 28]
G.39.2 - Creatures with "summoning sickness" cannot attack, and they cannot use any of their own abilities which have a tap symbol in the activation cost. Non-creatures are unaffected by summoning sickness. [Fifth Edition, Page 28]
G.39.3 - It does not matter if the permanent was a creature at the start of your most recent turn. You just had to control the permanent at that time. [Mirage, Page 14] So if you animate a land or artifact (see Rule K.5) that you controlled at the start of the turn, then it is not subject to the effects of summoning sickness.
G.39.Ruling.1 - Summoning sickness applies to all ways of getting a creature under your control. For example, casting them, putting them into play directly using Animate Dead or a similar effect, or by taking control from another player using Control Magic. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.39.Ruling.2 - If a permanent starts your turn in play under your control, leaves your control, and then returns in the same turn, then it will have summoning sickness. [Mirage, Page 28]
G.39.Ruling.3 - Creatures with summoning sickness can be tapped by spells or by abilities of other permanents. For example, Veteran's Voice and Icy Manipulator can be used to tap a creature which has summoning sickness. [D'Angelo 12/18/96]
G.39.Ruling.4 - If a non-creature is tapped for an ability on the turn it enters play, and then it is animated at some time before the ability resolves, the effect will not fail or fizzle. [D'Angelo 06/07/95]
G.40 - Tapping a Permanent
G.40.1 - To "tap" a permanent means to rotate it 90 degrees to show that it has been used. Permanents normally untap during the untap phase (see Rule P.5). [Fifth Edition, Page 73]
G.40.2 - You cannot tap an already tapped permanent as a cost. Costs (see Rule G.7) must be successfully paid. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]
G.40.3 - You can tap an already tapped permanent as part of the effect of a spell or ability. This has no effect on the permanent. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]
G.40.Ruling.1 - Tapping a permanent with an effect will never accidentally pay the cost of an ability. For example, tapping a land with Twiddle will not put a point of mana into a player's pool, and tapping a Prodigal Sorcerer with Twiddle will not make the player have to deal a point of damage to something. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.41 - Targeting--Announcing and Resolving
G.41.1 - You may not announce a targeted spell or ability unless you can choose a legal target. [Fifth Edition, Page 16]
G.41.2 - If a spell or ability has you (or other players) pick multiple targets, the same target may not be picked more than once. There is an implied "multiple different targets". [Fifth Edition, Page 37]
G.41.3 - If a spell or ability's resolution has you pick target(s) for an additional effect, you may choose the same target(s) that the original effect chose. [Mirage, Page 58]
G.41.4 - In addition to having a legal target when announced, a spell or ability checks its target to see if it is legal before it resolves. If its target is not legal, then the spell or ability fizzles (see Rule T.7.2 and Rule G.19) with respect to that target and does nothing. [Fifth Edition, Page 37]
G.41.5 - If a spell or ability has multiple targets and one or more of the targets become illegal prior to resolution, then the spell or ability still resolves with respect to its legal targets. [Fifth Edition, Page 37] For example, a Fireball is cast targeting three creatures with 2 damage each. If one creature is Unsummoned, then that target fizzles (see Rule G.19), but the other two creatures still take 2 damage each.
G.41.6 - If all of the targets are illegal upon resolution, then any untargeted portion of the spell or ability is also skipped. [Fifth Edition, Page 37] For example, Crumble targets an artifact to be buried and has an untargeted gaining of life. If the target becomes invalid and the spell fizzles, then no life will be given.
G.41.7 - If a spell or ability targets something only as part of the cost, then the target does not need to be legal upon resolution. For example, if a card says "Tap target creature: <-effect->", then the target is only checked on announcing. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 26]
G.41.8 - Some permanents have a target selected when they are cast which cannot be changed afterwards. If this target becomes illegal, the permanent stays in play (unless it is a local enchantment) in case the target becomes legal again. For example, Black Vise, and Kismet target a player when cast. [Mirage, Page 35] A targeted permanent can be identified by the use of the word "target" in the first clause of an unactivated ability, which is usually the timing part of the ability. For example, "At end of target opponent's upkpeep, do <-something->" or "As long as target opponent controls any <-something->, ...". [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98]
G.41.9 - If a spell or ability allows you to change the target of another spell or ability, the new target must be a legal choice. [WotC Rules Team 03/01/98]
G.41.Ruling.1 - There are many ways to make a target illegal before resolution. The most common way is for the target to be destroyed, sent a player's hand, or otherwise removed from play prior to resolution. Other requirements on the targeting may be invalidated due to adding Protection (see Rule A.24) to a target creature, or through the use of interrupts to change the color or wording of the spell or target.
G.41.Ruling.2 - You may not announce a targeted spell declaring an illegal target with the intent to use an interrupt afterward to somehow make the target legal. [Fifth Edition, Page 37]
G.41.Ruling.3 - Spells can be modified between being announced and being successfully cast. This is done by interrupts such as Magical Hack, and may result in making the original target choice illegal so the spell will fizzle.
G.41.Ruling.4 - Modifying the source of an ability after it is announced will not change the effects of that ability, so changing the source will not cause the effect to fizzle. See Rule K.4.4.
Note - Some spells are modal in their targeting. See Rule G.27.
Note - See the announcing (see Rule T.4) and resolution (see Rule T.7) steps of the spell life cycle for more information.
G.42 - Targeting--Is Something Targeted
G.42.1 - A spell or ability is targeted if (and only if) it uses the word "target" in its card text. [Fifth Edition, Page 16] When in doubt, read the card.
G.42.2 - There is one exception to Rule G.42.1. Local enchantments target the permanent they are being placed on at the time they are played even though they do not use the word "target". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
G.42.Ruling.1 - Abilities which trigger on the assignment of blockers are not targeted unless they explicitly say they are. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94] For example, Protection from Green (see Rule A.24) will not prevent a creature from being destroyed by the Thicket Basilisk's ability.
G.42.Ruling.2 - Abilities which trigger on damage being dealt in combat are not targeted unless they explicitly say they are. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]
G.42.Ruling.3 - Local enchantments on a permanent target the permanent (as a spell) when cast and continue to target it (as a permanent) while in play. The abilities of enchantments generally do not target the card they are on, however. For example, Firebreathing's effect does not target the creature to give it +1/+0 and Regeneration does not target the creature when it is used. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95] See Rule K.14.4 and Rule K.14.5.
G.42.Ruling.4 - Damage prevention and redirection spells and abilities are usually not targeted at anything, but they may target something if they explicitly say so. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
G.42.Ruling.5 - Spells and abilities which affect a card in the graveyard are usually targeted. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]
G.42.Ruling.6 - Spells and abilities which affect "all" of something are not targeted and can be played even if there are none of the somethings available. For example, you can use Flashfires even if there are no Plains in play. This is because the spell does not require a target to act upon. It just does something.
Note - Some older cards are not properly worded to include the word "target" where they should. Check the card rulings for possible errata or newer card text.
G.43 - Targeting--Valid Targets
G.43.Ruling.1 - You may target a spell/ability which removes an ability at a permanent without that ability. It just does nothing. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]
G.43.Ruling.2 - You may target a tapping spell or ability at a tapped card or an untapping spell or ability at an untapped card unless the card says it targets a tapped or untapped permanent. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 22] See Rule G.40.3 and Rule G.45.3.
G.43.Ruling.3 - Spells that target "attacking" or "defending" creatures may only be used during an attack and only if there is an appropriate creature to target. [bethmo 1994]
G.43.Ruling.4 - You cannot target a spell which will become a permanent with a spell or ability that targets a permanent until the permanent resolves. Prior to it resolving, it is just a spell. [bethmo 1994]
G.43.Ruling.5 - Valid targets only include things in play unless the spell or ability specifically says otherwise. [D'Angelo 02/22/99] For example, Unsummon can only work on a creature in play, while Raise Dead only works on a creature card in the graveyard.
G.44 - Unblocked
G.44.1 - A creature is considered "unblocked" only during an attack and only after blockers are declared. [D'Angelo 08/18/97]
G.45 - Untapping a Permanent
G.45.1 - To "untap" a permanent means to straighten a card's orientation to show that it is now ready to be used. Permanents normally untap during the untap phase (see Phase P.5). [Fifth Edition, Page 73]
G.45.2 - You cannot untap an already untapped permanent as a cost. Costs must be successfully paid. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]
G.45.3 - You can untap an already untapped permanent as part of the effect of a spell or ability. This has no effect on the permanent. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]
G.45.Ruling.1 - Untapping a permanent with an effect will never counter or otherwise cancel any already announced ability of that permanent. It merely makes the card available for them to use it again. [bethmo 1994]
Note - A card with an untap cost (see Rule A.10) can be untapped by an effect such as Twiddle without paying the untap cost. See Rule A.10.Ruling.1.
K - Card and Permanent Types and Information
K.1 - Card Types
K.1.1 - A card's type is listed on the center of the card. The following are legal card types: Land, Summon, Artifact, Artifact Creature, Enchantment, Sorcery, Instant, Interrupt, and Mana Source.
K.1.Ruling.1 - Summon cards also list a creature type. See Rule K.13 for more information.
K.1.Ruling.2 - Enchantment cards may also list additional information. See Rule K.14 for more information.
K.2 - Permanents
K.2.1 - A permanent is a card or token which is "in play" (see Rule Z.10). [Fifth Edition, Page 14]
K.2.2 - A given permanent may be one (or more than one) of the following types: Land, Creature, Artifact, and Enchantment. [Fifth Edition, Page 14]
K.2.3 - Spells which are to become permanents are put into play at the end of the resolution of that spell. See Rule T.7.1.
K.2.4 - Once in play, a permanent stays in play until something specifically removes it. [Fifth Edition, Page 14] You cannot get rid of a permanent just because you want to. [Fifth Edition, Page 14]
K.2.5 - If a spell or ability changes a permanent's type, it replaces all previous and current types. The spell or ability may list types which remain. For example, Stalking Stones says that it remains a land when it changes into a creature. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
K.2.6 - If a spell or ability changes a permanent's type, none of the abilities of the permanent are changed unless the effect says they do. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] In addition, if the card was a land, all mana producing abilities are still played as a mana source even if the card did not say so explicitly. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] Note that this rule does not apply to changing one land type to another type. See Rule K.18.3. [D'Angelo 03/19/99]
K.2.Ruling.1 - When in play, a permanent is no longer considered to be a spell, so it cannot be affected by things which target spells. For example, a counterspell cannot be used on a creature in play. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.2.Ruling.2 - You do not need to keep paying the cost of a permanent which is in play (unless a card tells you otherwise). [Fifth Edition, Page 14]
K.2.Ruling.3 - Changing a permanent's subtype, such as its land type, does not erase its other types as per Rule K.2.5. [bethmo 02/24/99]
Note - The abilities of permanents are played as Instants unless otherwise stated on the card. [Fifth Edition, Page 14] See Rule A.2.3.
K.3 - Spells
K.3.1 - A spell is a non-land card being played from your hand. [Fifth Edition, Page 72]
K.3.2 - A spell only can only affect permanents in play and players unless otherwise stated on the card.
Note - Using the ability (see Rule A.1) of a permanent is not considered to be a spell.
K.4 - Characteristics
K.4.1 - Every card and token has characteristics which define it. The following count as characteristics: name, color, casting cost, card type, type of permanent, type of spell or ability, creature type, expansion symbol, abilities, flavor text, power, and toughness. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
K.4.2 - All rules, but not cards, which check characteristics will also know the permanent's controller, and (if it is a local enchantment) what the permanent enchants. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
K.4.3 - The characteristics of a spell start out with the characteristics of the card. They are then tracked through the spell's life cycle. Changing the spell (with a Sleight of Mind or Chaoslace or similar effect) can change the spell's characteristics. If the spell becomes a permanent, however, it enters play with its base characteristics and with an effect on it, just as if Sleight of Mind (or whatever) were cast after it came into play. [bethmo 05/22/98]
K.4.4 - The characteristics of an ability start out with the characteristics of the permanent that generated the ability, or if it is an ability of a card not in play, then it starts with the characteristics of the card. This is locked in when the ability is announced. The characteristics are then tracked through the ability's life cycle separately from the source of the ability. Changing the source of the ability (with a Sleight of Mind or similar effect) or even destroying the source of the ability will not change the ability. [Mirage, Page 26] Note that few abilities refer to their own characteristics. They usually refer to the characteristics of their source, which pulls Rule K.4.5 and Rule K.4.6 into effect. [D'Angelo 04/11/99]
K.4.5 - If a spell or ability is to check the characteristics of something during its resolution, then the characteristics are looked up on an as-needed basis. They do not get "locked in" at any particular point in time. [bethmo 10/23/98]
K.4.6 - If a spell or ability is to check the characteristics of something and that something is no longer in play at the start of resolution, use the last value that something had before it left play. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
K.4.Ruling.1 - Abilities gained by any means count as part of the characteristics. For example, the text added by Zombie Master, the Mountainwalk and +1/+1 granted by Goblin King. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
K.4.Ruling.2 - Characteristics do not include the abilities of enchantments that are on a permanent. For example, the "cannot be targeted" ability of Favorable Destiny is not granted to the creature. [Aahz 08/04/97]
K.4.Ruling.3 - If a spell or ability targets itself or its source and needs to check the characteristics during resolution, it will check during resolution just like it would if targeting something other than itself. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]
K.4.Ruling.4 - If the ability of a permanent says "<-cardname-> does <-something->", then the effect is considered to come from the permanent, so if you need to check characteristics, such as color, then check the permanent on resolution. This means that changes to the permanent can possibly affect the result. See Rule K.4.5. [bethmo 11/03/98]
K.4.Ruling.5 - If the ability of a permanent says "Do <-something->", then the ability is doing the effect, not the permanent. In this case, you use the characteristics of the ability, which by Rule K.4.4 are the same as what the permanent had when the ability was announced. [bethmo 11/03/98]
Note - Triggered abilities lock in characteristics in slightly different ways. See Rule A.8.7.
K.5 - Animating Artifacts and Lands
K.5.1 - The term "animating" means to turn a card into a creature in addition to its current type.
K.5.2 - Once animated, the land or artifact is now a creature in all regards and is subject to all the rules for creatures, such as summoning sickness (see Rule G.39).
K.5.3 - When a land or artifact is animated, it is not given a color. It stays the color it is, which is usually colorless. [Peterson 10/14/94]
K.5.4 - When a land or artifact is animated, it does not get a creature type unless the spell or ability that animates it says it does. For example, the Forests animated by Living Lands have no creature type. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97] [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 31]
K.5.5 - When a land or artifact is animated, it does not change its casting cost. Lands have a casting cost of zero. Artifacts maintain their casting cost. [bethmo 1994]
K.5.6 - When a land or artifact is animated, the power/toughness specified in the ability are considered as its base power/toughness just as if those numbers were written on the bottom-right corner of the card. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] This means that counters and effects on power/toughness are applied after this base value.
K.5.7 - If an effect re-animates an already animated land or artifact, the effects changes the base power/toughness of the creature and not the current power/toughness of the creature. This is true because all such cards now have errata to use the word "base". [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] Thus, a Mishra's Factory with a -1/-1 counter cannot override the counter no matter how many times it is used.
K.5.8 - If an effect re-animates an already animated land or artifact and the effect changes the abilities of the creature, the abilities listed become the base abilities of the creature. This is true because all such cards now have errata to use the word "base". [WotC Rules Team 03/01/98] For example, if the animating effect says the creature becomes a "1/1 creature with Flying", Flying is considered a base ability.
K.5.9 - When a land or artifact de-animates, any counters, effects, and damage on it remain on it until they would normally be removed (if ever). If the counters or effects make no sense when applied to a non-creature, then they do not do anything. But if the land or artifact returns to being a creature, they may take effect again. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95] For example, a +1/+1 counter from Dwarven Weaponsmith would remain, the effect of Giant Growth will wear off at end of turn, and damage will be removed at end of turn.
K.5.Ruling.1 - Animating a land or artifact does not count as a "creature coming into play". It was already in play. It's just becoming a creature. [bethmo 06/30/97]
K.5.Ruling.2 - Since the animated cards are both creatures and some other type, they can be affected by spells which affect either type. For example, an animated land can be killed by Stone Rain or Terror. [D'Angelo 06/05/98]
K.5.Ruling.3 - It does not matter if the land or artifact was a creature at the start of your most recent turn. You just had to control the permanent at that time. [Mirage, Page 14] So if you animate a land or artifact that you controlled at the start of the turn, then it is not subject to the effects of summoning sickness. See Rule G.39.3.
K.5.Ruling.4 - When a land or artifact de-animates, any enchant creatures on it are immediately buried. See Rule K.14.4.
K.6 - Artifact
K.6.1 - Artifact spells are considered "permanent spells" because they are put into play when they resolve and stay in play as permanents until a rule, spell, or ability removes them from play.
K.6.2 - Cards of type Artifact and Artifact Creature are considered artifacts while in or out of play.
K.6.3 - A permanent in play may become an artifact due to the effect of a spell or ability. Turning a permanent into an artifact does not change the color of that permanent to "colorless". The permanent keeps its color. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.6.4 - The abilities of an artifact, which is not also a creature or a land, are "turned off" when the artifact is in a tapped state. This includes continuous abilities (see Rule A.4), triggered abilities (see Rule A.8), activated abilities (see Rule A.2), phase abilities (see Rule A.5), and more. [Fifth Edition, Page 15]
K.6.5 - Some abilities are not "turned off". The exceptions to Rule K.6.4 are: 1) any phase costs must still be dealt with [Fifth Edition, Page 49], 2) any abilities which are used to untap the artifact are usable, 3) any time the card says something happens when it is in a tapped state (for example, Mana Vault damage). [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]
K.6.Ruling.1 - Artifacts typically have no color due to the fact that their casting cost includes no colored mana, but they can be given a color by a spell or ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 66]
K.6.Ruling.2 - On some really old cards (from Limited Edition, Unlimited Edition, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities), the term "Mono Artifact" appeared on cards. All such cards have errata to remove the word "Mono" and add a tap symbol to the card's activation cost. If it did not have an activation cost, it gains one that only requires tapping.
K.6.Ruling.3 - On some really old cards (from Limited Edition, Unlimited Edition, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities), the term "Poly Artifact" appeared on cards. All such cards have errata to remove the word "Poly".
K.6.Ruling.4 - On some really old cards (from Limited Edition, Unlimited Edition, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities), the term "Continuous Artifact" appeared on cards. All such cards have errata to remove the word "Continuous".
K.6.Ruling.5 - When an artifact leaves play, any continuous effects it had end immediately, but any duration effects it had last. For example, when Kormus Bell leaves play, Swamps in play stop being creatures, but when a Baton of Morale leaves play, the banding effect continues until end of turn. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Artifact spells can be cast only during your main phase and only to start a batch. See Rule T.8.4 and Rule P.8.2.
K.7 - Artifact Creature
K.7.1 - Artifact Creature spells are considered "permanent spells" because they are put into play when they resolve and stay in play as permanents until a rule, spell, or ability removes them from play.
K.7.2 - Cards of type Artifact Creature are both artifacts and creatures in all ways and are affected by anything that affects either type of card.
K.7.Ruling.1 - Because they are creatures, they are subject to creature restrictions such as summoning sickness (see Rule G.39).
K.7.Ruling.2 - Because they are creatures as well as artifacts, their abilities are not turned off when they are tapped. See Rule K.6.4.
K.7.Ruling.3 - Artifact Creature cards are considered to be "creature cards" wherever they may be, in play, in your hand, or wherever.
K.7.Ruling.4 - Artifact Creature cards are not considered to be "summon spells".
Note - See Rule K.6.3 about a creature becoming an artifact.
Note - See Rule K.5 about an artifact becoming a creature.
Note - Artifact Creature spells can be cast only during your main phase and only to start a batch. See Rule T.8.4 and Rule P.8.2.
K.8 - Card Name
K.8.1 - A card's name is the name printed near the top of the card.
K.8.2 - Whenever a card mentions its own name in its text, it means to refer to itself, not to all cards of its name. [bethmo 11/18/96] A good rule of thumb is to replace all instances of a card's own name with the words "this card" when reading it.
K.8.3 - It is possible for a card to end up with more than one name due to some effects. The card is still considered to be one card even when it has multiple names. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Token creatures have a card name as specified in the spell or ability that generated them. See Rule K.25.3.
K.9 - Casting Cost
K.9.1 - The "casting cost" of a spell is the mana specified in the upper right hand corner of the card. [Fifth Edition, Page 4]
K.9.2 - If a spell or ability checks the "total casting cost" of a spell, it just adds up the number of mana in the casting cost, ignoring the color. [Mirage, Page 32] For example, Spell Blast has you pay X mana, where X is looked up from the total casting cost.
K.9.3 - A spell or ability may specify that the actual casting cost be paid instead of just an amount of mana equal to the casting cost. In this case, the actual colors matter. [D'Angelo 11/07/96] For example, Flash, Transmute Artifact, and Illusionary Mask.
K.9.Ruling.1 - The "casting cost" does not include any additional costs in the card text, or any additional costs imposed by other cards. Those apply to the "play cost" (see Rule K.21).
K.9.Ruling.2 - When a spell or ability allows you to cast a spell without paying the casting cost (or by decreasing what you have to pay), the casting cost is still considered to be the full amount even though you did not pay it. [Mirage, Page 32] See Rule K.21.
K.9.Ruling.3 - When a spell or ability allows you to cast a spell without paying the casting cost (or by decreasing what you have to pay), this will not affect costs which are not part of the casting cost. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] For example, Aluren will not pay for the extra cost imposed by Gloom.
K.9.Ruling.4 - A permanent in play by an effect such as Animate Dead still has a casting cost as printed on the card, even though that cost was never paid. [bethmo 1994]
Note - See "Play Cost" (Rule K.21) for more rulings on costs paid when casting a spell.
Note - See Rule K.27 for information on 'X' in the casting cost.
Note - Token creatures have a casting cost of zero. See Rule K.25.5.
Note - Animated lands have a casting cost of zero. See Rule K.5.5.
Note - Animated artifacts have a casting cost as printed on their card. See Rule K.5.5.
K.10 - Color of a Spell/Permanent
K.10.1 - The base color(s) of a spell are the color(s) of mana specified in the casting cost. [Fifth Edition, Page 27]
K.10.2 - The color of a permanent in play is the same as the color of the spell when it resolved. Thus, changing the color of a spell as it is being cast will change the color of the permanent that is put into play. [Mirage, Page 10] Note that cards which do color changes to a spell are effects and are not base changes, but these effects are in effect at the time the permanent enters play. [bethmo 07/07/98]
K.10.3 - If a card has only generic mana in its casting cost, or if it has no casting cost (which is the case with lands), then the card has no color and is said to be "colorless". [Fifth Edition, Page 27]
K.10.4 - A card with more than one color in its casting cost is considered to be of all the colors shown. [Fifth Edition, Page 27]
K.10.5 - If the color of a card is changed to a new value, this value overrides all the previous colors. [Fifth Edition, Page 27] For example, Thoughtlace will turn a multi-colored card to be just blue.
K.10.6 - A card with a zero casting cost may specify that it has a color in its card text. This text is considered explanatory and is not an ability. The text is subject to effects such as Sleight of Mind.
K.10.Ruling.1 - The background color of the card is used only as an aid. [Mirage, Page 10] For example, the error with the Serendib Efreet in the Revised Edition has a green background color, but the card is blue because the casting cost includes blue mana.
K.10.Ruling.2 - Since a card with more than one color is considered to be all of the colors shown (see Rule K.10.4), Terror cannot affect a card which is both black and red. Terror cannot target a black card. And a Circle of Protection from either color could prevent damage from the spell or permanent.
K.10.Ruling.3 - Because of Rule K.10.4, spells and abilities that affect something "non-black" will not affect things which are even partly black.
K.10.Ruling.4 - Since the mana symbols on the card determine its color (see Rule K.10.1), changing the mana symbols will change the base color definition of the card. Changing the base color will not override any effects which change the actual color, since the base is applied before other effect. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 24] For example, while Celestial Dawn is in play, a Phantom Monster will temporarily be white instead of blue. But if it had been Deathlaced to be black, it would stay black when Celestial Dawn came into play.
K.11 - Creature
K.11.1 - A creature card is a card of type "Summon" or "Artifact Creature".
K.11.2 - A creature in play may be a creature card, or it may be a land or artifact which has been animated (see Rule K.5).
K.11.Ruling.1 - Cards which refer to a "creature in the graveyard" or "dead creature" really mean a "creature card in the graveyard."
Note - See "Creature Type", Rule K.13, for more information.
Note - See "Creature Power and Toughness", Rule K.12, for more information.
K.12 - Creature Power and Toughness
K.12.1 - The base power/toughness of a creature is specified in the lower right hand corner of a creature card.
K.12.2 - Counters on a creature are applied before applying any external effects. [Aahz 09/28/97]
K.12.3 - A creature with negative power/toughness is considered to have zero power/toughness for all reasons other than for changing the power/toughness. [Fifth Edition, Page 27] For example, a creature with power of -2 deals zero damage in combat.
K.12.4 - A creature is considered to have "lethal damage" if it has at least as many points of damage on it as its toughness. A creature with "lethal damage" is destroyed. [Fifth Edition, Page 70]
K.12.5 - All asterisks (*) in the power/toughness of creature are considered to be zero when the card is not in play. [WotC Rules Team 07/01/98]
K.12.Ruling.1 - A creature with a toughness of zero will die from "lethal damage". See Rule K.12.4.
K.12.Ruling.2 - Because of Rule K.12.2, the current power/toughness of a creature is calculated like this: a) start with the base value, b) apply any plusses and minuses from counters, c) apply plusses and minuses from other effects in the order in which those effects entered play. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
K.12.Ruling.3 - Because of Rule K.12.2, an effect which sets the value of power/toughness will always override counters, even if the counters were put on the creature afterwards.
K.12.Ruling.4 - There used to be a rule that effects which set the power/toughness of a creature set the base value. This rule has been reversed. Effects that set power/toughness are applied in the order they entered play, just like all other effects.
K.12.Ruling.5 - Enchantments and other effects on a creature which change the power of the creature do not change the color of damage the creature does. [Mirage, Page 8] For example, a Mesa Pegasus with Firebreathing on it and Giant Growth cast on it still deals white damage.
K.12.Ruling.6 - Damage is not subtracted from toughness. A 5 toughness creature with 4 damage on it still has a toughness of 5 for all reasons. [bethmo 1994]
K.12.Ruling.7 - Death from "lethal damage" is considered a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13) and is therefore checked constantly by the game. Any change in toughness or addition of damage will cause this to be rechecked.
Note - Animated creatures (see Rule K.5) will specify the base power and toughness in the effect that animates them. See Rule K.5.6.
Note - A creature's toughness is checked against the damage on the creature each time Rule Effects are checked for. See Rule T.13.4.
Note - Damage on a creature accumulates during the turn and is removed at the end of the turn. See Rule G.11.2 and Rule P.10.
Note - No player is considered the controller of the Rule Effect (see Rule T.13) which puts a creature into the graveyard due to "lethal damage". See Rule T.13.4. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
K.13 - Creature Type
K.13.1 - For "Summon Xxxx" cards, the creature is of type "Xxxx". [Fifth Edition, Page 28]
K.13.2 - "Artifact Creature" cards do not have a creature type. [Fifth Edition, Page 28]
K.13.3 - Cards which say "Counts as a <-creature type->" (see Rule G.10) are considered to be of that creature type. [Mirage, Page 15] For example, Wall of Spears is an artifact creature which says "Counts as a Wall", so it is of creature type Wall.
K.13.4 - The plural of a creature type is the same as the base creature type. For example, Goblin and Goblins are the same, and Faerie and Faeries are the same. [Fifth Edition, Page 28]
K.13.5 - Creature types that differ only by gender are the same. For example, Actor and Actress are the same, as are Sorcerer and Sorceress, and Brother and Sister. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 36]
K.13.6 - If you are asked to choose a creature type, you do not have to choose a creature type which already exists in the game. You can make up your own type, such as Platypus, if you choose. You may not choose a name which has another meaning in the game, such as "opponent" or "land". Also, slanderous, obscene, and otherwise offensive choices are considered poor sportsmanship and may cause ejection from a tournament. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98] You can use compound nouns such as "Duck-Billed Platypus" and can use any existing creature type or creature name. For example, "Plague Rats" is a legal type. You cannot use the names of non-creature cards or any other term that means something in the game. [bethmo 04/23/98] You cannot choose the name of a non-creature spell in Magic, such as Fireball. [DeLaney 10/17/98]
K.13.7 - Changing a permanent to a specific creature type, with a card such as Fowl Play, removes all other creature types. [bethmo 04/08/99] It does not remove the Legendary nature of the creature if it was a Legend. See Rule K.19.5 for more information.
K.13.Ruling.1 - "Artifact Creature" and "Land Creature" are not creature types. Those are permanent types. [Mirage, Page 14]
K.13.Ruling.2 - Other card characteristics, such as color, do not count as a creature type either. So "red creatures" or "flying creatures" are not valid choices for a creature type. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 36]
K.13.Ruling.3 - Creatures can have more than one creature type. This most often happens because of "counts as" text (see Rule G.10). [Aahz 10/08/96]
K.13.Ruling.4 - Creature types which differ in a way other than specified by Rule K.13.4 and Rule K.13.5 are different. For example, Blinking Spirit and Spirit are different creature types. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 36] And a "Goblin Sliver" made with Volrath's Laboratory is neither a Goblin nor a Sliver. [behtmo 07/29/98]
Note - Animated lands and artifacts (see Rule K.5) do not have a creature type unless the effect specifically gives them one. See Rule K.5.4.
Note - Token creatures have a creature type the same as the token name. See Rule K.25.4.
Note - The Elder Dragon cards have errata to say "Summon Legend" instead of "Summon Elder Dragon Legend". They are of creature type Legend, and are not of creature type "Dragon". [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 36]
Note - The "Counts as a Xxxxx" creature type text applies even when the card is not in play. So a Teeka's Dragon is a Dragon even when it is in your graveyard, library, or hand. [Aahz 09/28/97] See Rule G.10.
K.14 - Enchantment
K.14.1 - Enchantment spells are considered "permanent spells" because they are put into play when they resolve and stay in play as permanents until a rule, spell, or ability removes them from play.
K.14.2 - Global enchantments are of card type "Enchantment" or "Enchant World". They are played in your territory and may affect any number of players or permanents. [Fifth Edition, Page 17]
K.14.3 - Local enchantments are of card type "Enchant <-something->". They are played on a permanent of type <-something->, and may or may not be in your territory. [Fifth Edition, Page 17] Note that "Enchant World" cards are not local enchantments.
K.14.4 - Local enchantments have a targeting requirement that they be on a card of the type <-something-> specified. If at any time the permanent they are on stops being of that card type, or if the permanent becomes untargetable by the enchantment, or if the permanent they are on leaves play, the enchantment will bury itself as a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13). [Fifth Edition, Page 18]
K.14.5 - Local enchantments may have text saying "Play on a <-restriction->" or "target something with <-restriction->". The <-restriction-> is considered a targeting restriction which applies when casting and while in play. If at any time the card it is on does not meet that restriction, the enchantment will bury itself as a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13). [Mirage, Page 22] For example, Armor of Thorns says "Play only on a nonblack creature" and it will bury itself if it ends up on a black creature.
K.14.6 - The text "enchanted <-something->" refers to the permanent which the local enchantment is on. It does not refer to any other permanent. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 54]
K.14.7 - Changing the controller of a permanent does not change the controller of local enchantments which are on the permanent. So if someone takes control of your Llanowar Elves with Regeneration on them, you still control the Regeneration card, and only you can pay to use it. [Mirage, Page 22]
K.14.8 - Enchant World cards are just like normal "Enchantment" cards, except that only one Enchant World can be in play at a time. If an Enchant World is brought into play, all other Enchant Worlds in play are buried as a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13). If more than one enters play at the same time, all of them are buried. [Legends Rulecard] [Mirage, Page 57] The game always knows which entered play first, even if they enter play during a single "event" (see Rule T.7.1). [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] Enchant Worlds are not like Legends. Legends allow one of any given name in play. Enchant Worlds just allow one in play, period. [D'Angelo 07/17/98]
K.14.9 - An enchantment is never a legal target for itself. [WotC Rules Team 08/18/98] For example, if a Licid is made to enchant itself, it will immediately bury itself because it is on an illegal target.
K.14.10 - The effect of a local enchantment on the permanent it enchants does not validate or invalidate any conditions in its own text. For example, a card which says "enchanted green creature is black" does not cause its effect to be cancelled, and a card which says "enchanted non-creature artifact is an artifact creature" does not cause itself to effect to be cancelled. Similarly, Transmogrifying Licid does not make its target legal when it says "enchanted creature is an artifact creature". [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99] You can play as if "enchanted A does B" instead read "as long as enchanted permanent is an A, it does B" so the enchantment's effect gets ordered after anything which would change the permanent to match the condition. [bethmo 04/08/99]
K.14.Ruling.1 - Global enchantments may target something when played, but they are still played in your territory. You do not play a global enchantment onto another player. [Mirage, Page 23]
K.14.Ruling.2 - Using the ability of a local enchantment usually does not target the card it is on. It can affect that card without targeting it. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 122] For example, the use of Firebreathing does not target the creature when it is used.
K.14.Ruling.3 - When an enchantment leaves play, any continuous effects it had end immediately, but any duration effects it had last. For example, when Armor of Faith leaves play, the +1/+1 is lost, but any extra toughness added by its ability lasts until end of turn. [bethmo 1994]
K.14.Ruling.4 - The term "<-something-> enchantment" refers to a local enchantment of type "Enchant <-something->". So a "creature enchantment" is an "Enchant Creature" card. [DeLaney 01/28/97]
K.14.Ruling.5 - Enchant World spells are not more powerful than other enchantments or effects. They are applied normally. [bethmo 07/07/94]
K.14.Ruling.6 - Enchantments are not specifically prevented from becoming tapped, but they generally do not tap. One exception to this is that Copy Artifact is both an artifact and an enchantment. [Aahz 10/11/96] The Licid cards can also end up as tapped enchantments. [D'Angelo 10/11/97]
K.14.Rulings.7 - Enchantments do not "turn off" when tapped. [D'Angelo 10/20/97]
Note - If two enchantments or other effects contradict one another, the most recently cast wins. See Rule T.14.
Note - Enchantment spells can be cast only during your main phase and only to start a batch. See Rule T.8.4 and Rule P.8.2.
K.15 - Instant
K.15.1 - Cards of type "Instant" are played as instants, and they are put into the graveyard when they resolve.
K.15.Ruling.1 - Abilities of permanents which are played as instants do not cause the card to go to the graveyard.
Note - Instants can be used at many times during both players turns. See Rule T.1.3, Rule T.1.4, and Rule T.1.5.
K.16 - Interrupt
K.16.1 - Cards of type "Interrupt" are played as interrupts, and they are put into the graveyard when they resolve.
K.16.Ruling.1 - Abilities of permanents which are played as interrupts do not cause the card to go to the graveyard.
Note - Interrupts can only be used during the interrupt period (see Rule T.5) of a spell's life cycle. They are typically used to counter or modify a spell or ability.
Note - You cannot respond to an interrupt with a non-interrupt. Interrupts are only played in interrupt Batches (see Rule T.8). See Rule T.5.2.
Note - Cards printed prior to Mirage and the introduction of Fifth Edition rules may be labeled as interrupts when they are not. All such cards that produce mana (and no other effect at the same time) work as mana sources instead of interrupts. All such cards that have an effect that does not produce mana and it does not target a spell or ability are played as instants. [Mirage, Page 2-4] This is considered mass errata.
Note - Cards which are modal and can either target a spell or do something else are played as interrupts or as instants as appropriate. But they are still considered to be spell type "interrupt" in any case. [Mirage, Page 39]
K.17 - Land
K.17.1 - Lands can only be played during your main phase. See Rule P.8.1.
K.17.2 - Tapping a land for mana is always done as a mana source, even if the card does not say so. [Mirage, Page 12]
K.17.3 - Lands have no color. For example, Forests are not green cards. They can be given a color by a spell or ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 69]
K.17.4 - If there is a question about what mana gets produced by a land, first figure out what kind of land it is by applying any land type changing effects (like Conversion or Phantasmal Terrain) in the order they entered play. Then figure out what color mana it produces by applying any color changing effects (like Reality Twist). Finally figure out any additional mana that might be produced (from Wild Growth, Mana Flare, etc.). [Fifth Edition, Page 61]
K.17.Ruling.1 - Not all lands produce mana. If a land does not specifically say that it produces mana, then it does not. [Mirage, Page 12]
K.17.Ruling.2 - Land cards are not considered "mana sources". They often have an ability which is played as a mana source, but they are not mana sources. [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]
K.17.Ruling.3 - If a spell or ability puts a land into play (see Rule G.31), this does not count as you playing a land for any reason. For example, it does not count as your one land for that turn. [bethmo 11/05/96]
K.17.Ruling.4 - When a land leaves play, any continuous effects it had end immediately, but any duration effects it had last. For example, when Glacial Chasm leaves play, you no longer get its benefit. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.17.Ruling.5 - Tapping a land for an effect other than just generating mana is done as an instant unless otherwise stated on the card. [D'Angelo 06/05/98] See Rule A.2.3.
Note - See "Land Type", Rule K.18, for more information.
Note - Lands are not spells. See Rule K.3.1.
Note - Playing a land is not a spell or ability. It is a special action. You cannot play a land in response to something or respond to someone playing a land. See Rule P.8.3.
K.18 - Land Type
K.18.1 - All lands have a land type that is the same as the land card's name. In addition, lands may "count as" (see Rule G.10) other types.
K.18.2 - Basic land types are: Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp. All other land types are not considered basic lands. [Fifth Edition, Page 6]
K.18.3 - Changing a land to another land type erases the card name and all abilities of the old land type and puts in the abilities and card name of the new land type. [Mirage, Page 58] For example, if a land is turned into a Swamp, it's card name is now Swamp, its land type is Swamp, and its card text is "Tap: Add B to your mana pool."
K.18.4 - Changing a land to another land type does not change other characteristics of the card, such as color, and so on. [Mirage, Page 58] Expansion symbols are not erased. [Aahz 10/07/95]
K.18.5 - Changing a permanent to a basic land removes all other land sub-types of the permanent. It does not remove any other types the permanent has, such as creature or artifact. [bethmo 04/10/99]
K.18.Ruling.1 - If a land is animated into a creature by a duration effect (such as Mishra's Factory or Thelonite Druid), and its land type is changed, then it will stay animated until the animation effect ends. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]
Note - See "Snow-Covered Lands", Rule K.22, for more information on them.
K.19 - Legendary Permanents
K.19.1 - Only one legendary permanent of a given name can be in play at a time. If a legendary permanent enters play when one is already in play, the new one is buried. If more than one enters play at the same time, then all of them are buried. [Mirage, Page 56]
K.19.2 - The burial is done as a Rule Effect (see Rule T.13). This will happen so quickly that there is no way you can use abilities (other than mana sources and replacement abilities) of the duplicate card or sacrifice it to something before it gets buried. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.19.3 - Legendary creatures are of creature type Legend, so have the card type entry of "Summon Legend". Other legendary permanents are listed as "Legendary Artifact", "Legendary Enchantment", and "Legendary Land". [Mirage, Page 56]
K.19.4 - If a Summon Legend is changed to a non-creature type, it is still a legendary permanent. This is true for any type changes to legendary permanents. They do not lose their legendary status. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
K.19.5 - Any change to a permanent which changes the card's name can remove Legendary status. A change which does not change the card's name will not remove Legendary status. [bethmo 04/10/99]
K.19.Ruling.1 - A spell or ability that affects "all legends" is referring to "all Summon Legend" creatures and all Legendary permanents. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
K.19.Ruling.2 - If one legend is phasing out while another is phasing in, they will not see one another. [bethmo 09/19/96] See Rule G.30.6.
K.19.Ruling.3 - If a legend is changed so that it is not a legend for a while, then it changes back, it is considered the new one in play. [Mirage, Page 56]
K.19.Ruling.4 - Copy cards, such as Clone, do copy the legendary nature of a card. The copy will be the new legend entering play and will bury itself. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]
K.19.Ruling.5 - The game always knows exactly which legend entered play first (or that they entered play at the same time), even if they both enter during the same "event" of a single effect. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
K.19.Ruling.6 - The burial effect is controlled by the player who controls the permanent that is burying itself. [D'Angelo 07/30/96]
K.19.Ruling.7 - Token creatures (see Rule K.25) can be legends. [Mirage, Page 56]
K.19.Ruling.8 - Due to Rule K.19.2, a Legendary Land with a mana source ability can have its ability used before it is buried. Also, a mana source ability (but not an instant or sorcery ability) of another permanent could sacrifice a legendary permanent before it is buried. [D'Angelo 11/24/98]
K.19.Ruling.9 - The newer permanent is buried (as per Rule K.19.1) even if the two legends with the same name are somehow different card types. [WotC Rules Team 03/18/99]
Note - Two or more legendary permanents with different names can be in play at the same time.
Note - A card is not a Legend just because a card has a gold border. It has to say "Summon Legend" or "Legendary <-type->" on its card type.
Note - All "Summon Legend" and "Legendary Land" cards were on the DCI restricted list (only 1 per deck) for all tournaments from 08/01/94 until 11/01/95.
K.20 - Mana Source
K.20.1 - Cards of type "Mana Source" are played as mana sources, and they are put into the graveyard when they resolve.
K.20.Ruling.1 - Abilities of permanents which are played as mana sources do not cause the card to go to the graveyard.
Note - Mana Sources can be used at many times during both players turns. Basically, if there is any time you might need mana, there will be a chance to use mana sources just prior to that. See Rule T.12.
Note - There are only a few spells of type Mana Source, including Burnt Offering, Culling the Weak, Dark Ritual, Sacrifice, and Songs of the Damned.
K.21 - Play Cost
K.21.1 - The "play cost" for a spell or ability is what you actually have to pay to play the spell or ability. The cost may include mana and non-mana aspects.
K.21.2 - The "play cost" for a spell is the "casting cost" (see Rule K.9) plus any additional cost increases or decreases that are applied. The "play cost" for an ability is the "activation cost" (see Rule G.1) plus any additional cost increases or decreases that are applied. [D'Angelo 11/19/97]
K.21.3 - If an instant, interrupt, sorcery, or mana source spell has a cost listed as "<-cost->: <-effect->" in its text, then the cost can be paid only once, and this is considered part of the play cost. [Fifth Edition, Page 16]
K.21.4 - If a card's text includes "At the time you play <-card name->, do <-something->", then it is describing an additional part of the play cost. This is paid only once and is paid when announcing the card. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
K.21.5 - To figure out the total play cost: a) Start with the casting cost (see Rule K.9). b) Apply cost increases from the card itself (such as from Buyback (see Rule A.13) or the extra mana in Drain Life) and cost increases from other effects (such as from Gloom). c) Apply cost reductions from the card itself (such as with the Pitch cards, see Rule E.10) or from other cards (such as Helm of Awakening or Pearl Medallion). [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
K.21.Ruling.1 - Using the Buyback (see Rule A.13) ability is part of the play cost of a spell, and is added in before you apply cost decreases. See Rule A.13.Ruling.1.
K.21.Ruling.2 - The result of Rule K.21.4 is that the Medallions and other cost decreasers can be applied to any part of the play cost, and not just the casting cost. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.21.Ruling.3 - Once a spell is announced (see Rule T.4), there is no way to retroactively change the play cost. It has already been paid. For example, if you use a Sleight of Mind to change Gloom so it affects green spells, it will not make an already announced green spell cost more. [bethmo 1994]
Note - See "Casting Cost", Rule K.9, for more information.
Note - See "Activation Cost", Rule G.1, for more information.
K.22 - Snow-Covered Lands
K.22.1 - Snow-Covered lands are treated like non-Snow-Covered lands of the same type. Being Snow-Covered does not change the land's type. [Mirage, Page 62]
K.22.2 - Snow-Covered is an attribute of a land and can be granted or removed, much like Flying can be granted or removed from a creature. [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98]
K.22.3 - If a land's type is changed, the Snow-Covered attribute will neither be added nor removed. For example, if you use Phantasmal Terrain to change a Snow-Covered Plains into a Mountain, you end up with a card named Mountain that is Snow-Covered. [Mirage, Page 62]
K.22.Ruling.1 - Because of Rule K.22.1, anything which affects Plains will affect Snow-Covered Plains, and Forestwalk will work on a Snow-Covered Forest. Since the land type is not changed, things which check land type will see the actual land type. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]
K.22.Ruling.2 - An effect can specifically look for a Snow-Covered land, much like an effect can specifically look for red creatures. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]
K.22.Ruling.3 - Cards which look for a kind of Landwalk work whether or not the Landwalk is more specific or not. For example, an effect that targets a creature with Islandwalk will work on one with Snow-Covered Islandwalk. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 51]
K.22.Ruling.4 - The cards Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Island, Snow-Covered Mountain, Snow-Covered Plains, and Snow-Covered Swamp are considered basic lands of the appropriate type. [Mirage, Page 62] This is true even when they are out of play. So Land Tax can be used to select such lands. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]
K.22.Ruling.5 - If you manage to make a non-basic land gain the Snow-Covered attribute, it does not become a basic land. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]
K.22.Ruling.6 - Swamp and Snow-Covered Swamp are different card names. [D'Angelo 01/07/96] For example, Nebuchadnezzar's effect could have you name either one of these names.
K.22.Ruling.7 - To be Snow-Covered, a land must say that it is Snow-Covered, or an effect must make the land Snow-Covered. Just having snow in the card art does not make it Snow-Covered. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
K.22.Ruling.8 - If a spell or ability asks you to select a land type, you cannot restrict the land type with an attribute like Snow-Covered, just like you cannot restrict the land type by color. [WotC Rules Team 05/01/98]
K.23 - Sorcery
K.23.1 - Cards of type "Sorcery" are played as sorceries, and they are put into the graveyard when they resolve.
K.23.Ruling.1 - Abilities of permanents which are played as sorceries do not cause the card to go to the graveyard.
Note - Sorceries can be cast only during your main phase and only to start a batch. See Rule T.8.4 and Rule P.8.2.
K.24 - Summon
K.24.1 - Summon spells are considered "permanent spells" because they are put into play when they resolve and stay in play as permanents until a rule, spell, or ability removes them from play.
K.24.Ruling.1 - When a summon card leaves play, any continuous effects it had end immediately, but any duration effects it had last. For example, when Goblin King leaves play, Goblins no longer get its benefit. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Summon spells can be cast only during your main phase and only to start a batch. See Rule T.8.4 and Rule P.8.2.
K.25 - Token Creatures
K.25.1 - Token creatures are in all ways like normal card-based permanents, except they are not cards for effects which look for cards. [Fifth Edition, Page 31]
K.25.2 - The color of a token is defined by the effect that generates the token. If no color is specified, the token is colorless. [Fifth Edition, Page 31] They do not inherit the color of the spell or ability that generated them.
K.25.3 - The name of a token is specified by the effect that generates the token. [Fifth Edition, Page 31] For example, ones generated by The Hive are called Wasps.
K.25.4 - The creature type of a token is the same as the token name, in addition to any creature types named by the effect. [Fifth Edition, Page 32]
K.25.5 - Token creatures have a casting cost (see Rule K.9) of zero. [Fifth Edition, Page 32]
K.25.6 - Token creatures are removed from the game entirely if they ever leave play (to the hand, graveyard, phase out, or wherever). [Fifth Edition, Page 32] This happens faster than any spell or ability, so there is no way to target or affect a token which is not in play. [Aahz 08/05/97]
K.25.7 - Token creatures are "owned" by the player that controlled the spell or ability that put the token into play. [Aahz 06/08/95] This is true even if the token is put into play under another player's control. [bethmo 05/16/96]
K.25.Ruling.1 - Before leaving the game (as per Rule K.25.6), token creatures do briefly go where they are sent, which can trigger effects. For example, Soul Net can be used on a token creature going to the graveyard. [Mirage, Page 24]
K.25.Ruling.2 - Token creatures are not considered to have expansion symbols.
K.25.Ruling.3 - A Clone (or other copy card) used on a token is a card and not a token, so it will not follow the token rules.
K.26 - Walls
K.26.1 - Creatures with the creature type "Wall" may not attack unless a spell or ability specifically enables them to do so. [Fifth Edition, Page 18]
K.26.Ruling.1 - Walls cannot attack even if you raise their power above zero.
K.26.Ruling.2 - Walls are in all ways creatures. They are affected by any spell or ability that affects creatures (including Paralyze, Terror, and Incinerate). They are just a type of creature which cannot attack. [Fifth Edition, Page 18]
Note - See "Creature Type", Rule K.13, for more information.
K.27 - X Costs
K.27.1 - When an 'X' appears in the casting cost of a spell, you must choose a value for X that is a non-negative integer. Zero is legal unless otherwise stated on the card.
K.27.2 - If more than one 'X' is in the casting cost, both 'X's must have the same value. In fact, all 'X's on the card are considered to have the same value. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 27] For example, a spell that costs "XXU" to cast will cost "4U" if you choose for 'X' to be 2, and "6U" if you choose for 'X' to be 3.
K.27.3 - If there is an 'X' in the casting cost of a spell, consider the amount paid in 'X' to be part of the cost during casting, but 'X' is zero after the card becomes a permanent or while the card is anyplace other than in the process of being cast. [Mirage, Page 31]
K.27.Ruling.1 - The value of 'X' is chosen when announcing the spell and you cannot change this value later.
K.27.Ruling.2 - If a card is put into play by means other than casting, any X in the casting cost is considered to be zero. [D'Angelo 06/05/98]
M - Multi-Player Rules
M.1 - Multi-Player Rulings
M.1.1 - There are no official multi-player (meaning, more than 2 player) rules for Magic, but there are some rules for how cards should be read in a multi-player game. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
M.1.2 - If a card says "both players", it means "all players. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
M.1.3 - If a permanent targets a player when it is cast, then this choice of player may not be changed during the rest of the game. It may not even be changed if the permanent changes controllers. If the target player leaves the game, then the permanent becomes useless but stays in play. [WotC Rules Team 01/10/95] For example, Black Vise.
M.1.4 - If a permanent targets a player when it is activated, you may choose a different player each time it is used. [WotC Rules Team 01/10/95] For example, Prodigal Sorcerer.
M.1.5 - If a spell or ability says something is of "the opponent's choice", then you can pick an opponent each time the choice is to be made. [WotC Rules Team 01/10/95] For example, Demonic Hordes and Clergy of the Holy Nimbus.
M.1.6 - The rules for Series (see Rule T.9) and the rules for who announces next in a Batch (see Rule T.8) specify the "active player first, then the other player". In a multi-player game, this should start with the current player and go around the table in the direction of play. [D'Angelo 10/06/96]
M.1.Ruling.1 - In most multi-player rules, if a player is "killed", all of the cards that player owns are immediately removed from the game, regardless of who controls them at the time. [D'Angelo 10/06/96]
M.2 - Free-For-All Style
M.2.1 - "Opponent" is defined as any player other than yourself. [WotC Rules Team 01/10/95]
M.3 - Team Play
M.3.1 - "Opponent" is defined as any player not on your team. [WotC Rules Team 01/10/95]
P - Phases of the Turn
P.1 - Starting the Game
P.1.1 - Prior to the first phase of the first turn of the game, each player brings their deck to the play area and shuffles it. The opponent may also cut (or shuffle then cut) the deck. Each player's deck becomes their Library (see Rule Z.5). [Fifth Edition, Page 10]
P.1.2 - The Library size must be 40 or more cards. [Fifth Edition, Page 1] Note - DCI tournament rules all require a larger deck size. See Rule D.13.5, Rule D.14.5, Rule D.15.4, Rule D.16.7, Rule D.17.4, and Rule D.19.6.
P.1.3 - One player gets to choose if they want to go first or not. The player that goes first skips their draw during their first draw phase. This is called the "play or draw" choice. [Fifth Edition, Page 10]
P.1.4 - If this is the first game between players, randomly determine who gets the choice in Rule P.1.3. If this is not the first game, then the loser of the previous game chooses. If the previous game was a draw, then the player who chose last time chooses this time. [Fifth Edition, Page 46]
P.1.5 - After the choice is made, each player draws a hand of 7 cards and the game begins with each player having 20 life. [Fifth Edition, Page 8]
Note - The DCI tournament rules also include something called a "mulligan". See Rule D.10.3.
P.2 - Phases of the Turn
P.2.1 - Each turn is divided into 6 phases, plus the beginning of the turn. a. Beginning of the turn b. Phase 1: Untap c. Phase 2: Upkeep d. Phase 3: Draw e. Phase 4: Main f. Phase 5: Discard g. Phase 6: Cleanup
P.2.2 - Each turn is played completely through all the phases by one player, and then play proceeds to the opponent who then takes a turn, and so on. [Fifth Edition, Page 8] Note - Various spells and abilities can cause a player to skip a turn or get an extra turn.
P.2.Ruling.1 - You still have every phase in every turn even if nothing happens during one of the phases. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
P.3 - Structure of a Phase
P.3.1 - Each phase is broken into 5 parts. They are: [Fifth Edition Page 47] 1. Beginning of the phase. Play all abilities and scheduled effects that occur at the beginning of the phase. This is done in a Series (see Rule T.9). 2. The main body of the phase. This can contain any number of batches of spells and abilities (if such are legal). See Rule T.8.1 about how to determine when a phase ends. 3. End of the Phase. Play all abilities and scheduled effects that occur at the end of the phase. This is done in a Series (see Rule T.9). Once this part starts, you cannot go back and announce more spells and abilities during this phase. 4. Check for mana burn. See Rule G.25. 5. Check for players losing the game. See Rule G.22.3.
P.3.2 - You cannot leave part 2 and enter part 3 of a phase until all "phase costs" (see Rule A.6) and mandatory "phase abilities" (see Rule A.7) which are nor specifically done at the end of the phase have been dealt with. [Fifth Edition, Page 47]
Note - If more than on thing happens at the beginning or end of a phase, follow the rules for Series (see Rule T.9) to determine what order they occur in.
P.4 - Beginning of Turn
P.4.1 - At the beginning of each turn, play any abilities or scheduled effects for this time in a Series (see T.9). [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
P.4.2 - Summoning sickness (see Rule G.39) is removed from permanents after the "beginning of turn" Series finishes. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 24]
P.4.Ruling.1 - Continuous abilities which do something at the beginning of the turn are dealt with prior to the actual "beginning of turn" Series. [Aahz 01/14/97] These may cause abilities to trigger. For example, Vibrating Sphere is a continuous effect, which may result in creatures being destroyed at this time.
P.4.Ruling.2 - If more than one effect can cause you to skip a turn, choose which one is making you skip just before you would start the turn. [Barclay 07/29/98] If an effect is optional, make the choice at the same time. [D'Angelo 11/06/96]
P.4.Ruling.3 - There is no time between turns to use mana sources. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
P.4.Ruling.4 - Mana sources which are used during this step do not actually cause mana burn (see Rule G.25) until the end of the first phase that you play. Normally this is the untap phase, but if you skip your untap it could be the upkeep phase. [Aahz 04/07/97]
P.5 - Phase 1: Untap
P.5.1 - During the middle of this phase, you must untap all your tapped permanents (those which are not prevented from untapping) as a mandatory phase ability (see Rule A.5). [Fifth Edition, Page 52] This phase ability is played in a Series (see Rule T.9) much like a begin/end of phase ability, rather than as an instant like a normal phase ability. [bethmo 01/11/99]
P.5.2 - Only spells and abilities which specifically say they can be played during the Untap Phase can be played during this phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 52] Mana sources are also allowed. [Fifth Edition, Page 43]
P.5.3 - The choice (if any) of what to untap is made when announcing the untap phase ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
P.5.4 - If something new happens that would force a decision about what to untap after you announce the untap ability, you must make that decision at the first opportunity, but you may not undo any previous decisions. For example, if a land becomes tapped after announcing and Winter Orb is in play, you may choose that land if you had none chosen before but may not choose it if you already had one chosen. [D'Angelo 11/13/96]
P.5.5 - All the chosen permanents and all permanents for which you had no choice about untap simultaneously during the resolution of the untap ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
P.5.Ruling.1 - You must untap your cards. You cannot "forget". [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
P.5.Ruling.2 - If something enters play after or during the untap ability resolving, the permanent entering play does not untap. [bethmo 05/16/96] For example, a Tawnos's Coffin untapping.
P.5.Ruling.3 - If untapping a permanent changes what other permanents may untap, those changes do not apply during this turn. [D'Angelo 01/09/98] For example, untapping a Winter Orb will not cause you to back up and choose only one land to untap
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1.
Note - Phasing happens at the beginning of untap. All phased out cards phase in, and all cards with Phasing (see Rule A.23) which are in play phase out. See Rule G.30.6.
Note - All Limited Edition, Unlimited Edition, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities cards which said to do things during the untap phase have errata to instead do something during the upkeep phase. See the various cards for actual errata.
P.6 - Phase 2: Upkeep
P.6.1 - Any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of instants may be played during this phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
Note - It is common for permanents or effects to offer abilities which can or must be played during the Upkeep phase. See phase abilities (see Rule A.5), phase costs (see Rule A.6), and untap abilities (see Rule A.10) for more information.
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1.
P.7 - Phase 3: Draw
P.7.1 - Any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of instants may be played during this phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
P.7.2 - The current player has a mandatory phase ability (see Rule A.5) of drawing a card. The ability is announced as an instant and the card is drawn on resolution. [Fifth Edition, Page 53]
P.7.Ruling.1 - You cannot skip a draw or take an additional draw unless a spell or ability says otherwise. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - If you try to draw and have no cards in your library to draw from, you lose the game. See Rule Z.5.7.
Note - Most abilities that provide extra draws during this phase are played as instants and are played separately from your normal draw. For example, if there are three Howling Mines in play, then each provides its own effect, rather than combining with the draw effect you get normally. Similarly, effects such as Sylvan Library would not combine with other card draws. [WotC Rules Team 10/12/94]
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1.
P.8 - Phase 4: Main
P.8.1 - During the main phase, you may do any of the following in any order: a. Start a Batch (see Rule T.8) by playing a spell or ability. You can do this any number of times, before or after other actions. b. Play a land. You can only do this once per turn. c. Declare an attack (see Rule C.2). You can only do this once per turn.
P.8.2 - This is the only phase in which you may cast sorcery, summon, enchantment, or artifact spells, or play sorcery abilities. Only the current player can use these during their main phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 53]
P.8.3 - Playing a land is a special action. It cannot be done in response to something and it cannot be responded to or interrupted. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]
P.8.4 - If there is a creature which is required to attack (due to a spell such as Siren's Call or an ability such as Nettling Imp), and that creature is not otherwise prevented from attacking, you cannot end your main phase without declaring an attack. [Mirage, Page 48] [WotC Rules Team 08/01/98]
P.8.Ruling.1 - The restriction of only one land or one attack may be overridden by other effects, such as Fastbond or Relentless Assault. But the rules for playing a land or declaring an attack are unchanged. [bethmo 1995]
P.8.Ruling.2 - You only get one attack per turn (see Rule P.8.1) even if you manage to untap your creatures. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - See Rule C.2 for how an attack is declared.
Note - Many players mistakenly think that the main phase must be ordered as "play a land, then play spells, then attack". You can do the steps in any order, and it is often good to play it like "attack, then play a land, then play spells". See Rule P.8.1.
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1. Also check these at the beginning and end of an attack (see Rule C.3.1 and Rule C.9.2) if an attack is made.
P.9 - Phase 5: Discard
P.9.1 - Any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of instants may be played during this phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
P.9.2 - The current player has a mandatory "end of phase" ability of discarding down to 7 cards in their hand. The ability is played as part of the "end of phase" Series (see Rule T.9). [Fifth Edition, Page 53]
P.9.Ruling.1 - The discard ability is played only once even if more cards somehow get into your hand afterwards. [Aahz 09/19/96]
P.9.Ruling.2 - You may not just choose to discard because you want to. You only do so if you have more than 7 cards or because a spell or ability tells you to do so. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - This is the last phase in which player can use instant spells and abilities before the next turn's upkeep phase.
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1.
P.10 - Phase 6: Cleanup
P.10.1 - The phase can be charted out like this: a. All beginning of cleanup abilities and scheduled effects are played in a Series (see Rule T.9). b. All damage is removed from all permanents and all "until end of turn" effects end simultaneously. This is played as a mandatory phase ability (see Rule A.5). This phase ability is played in a Series (see Rule T.9) much like a begin/end of phase ability, rather than as an instant like a normal phase ability. [bethmo 01/11/99] c. All "at end of turn" abilities and scheduled effects are played in a Series (see Rule T.9).
P.10.2 - Only spells and abilities which specifically say they can be played during the Cleanup phase can be played during this phase. [Fifth Edition, Page 53] Mana sources are also allowed. [Fifth Edition, Page 43]
P.10.3 - After the "until end of turn" effects end, if any new "until end of turn" effects begin, they end immediately after taking effect. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
P.10.4 - If any damage is dealt during this phase after damage is removed and the damage is not sufficient to kill the creature, the damage is immediately removed. [Fifth Edition, Page 54]
P.10.Ruling.1 - If any creature is reduced to zero or less toughness during this phase, it dies and cannot successfully live to the next turn because even if it regenerates, it will immediately die again. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Because the "at end of turn" step is played as a Series (see Rule T.9), if any new ones are generated by the same player, they are immediately handled. And once the current player ends their part of the series, any new ones for that player are simply ignored. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]
Note - Remember to check for mana burn and players losing the game at the end of the phase. See Rule P.3.1.
T - Timing of Spells and Abilities
T.1 - Types of Spells and Abilities
T.1.1 - The list of valid spell/ability types is: mana source, instant, interrupt, sorcery, artifact, artifact creature, summon, enchantment, triggered ability, replacement ability, damage prevention, phase ability, phase cost, and untap cost. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
T.1.2 - Artifacts (and artifact creatures), sorceries, summonings, and enchantments can only be used during your main phase and only to start a Batch (see Rule T.8) of spells and abilities. [Fifth Edition, Page 53] Such spells are sometimes referred to as "non-fast effects".
T.1.3 - Instants may be used on either player's turn during the Upkeep, Draw, Main, and Discard phases, or during specific steps during the Attack. They may either start a Batch (see Rule T.8) or be added to a Batch.
T.1.4 - Sometimes a spell is played as a different type than the type printed on the card. For example, sometimes an Instant, like Healing Salve is played during damage prevention (see Rule T.10) as a damage prevention spell. It is still an instant for anything that checks the spell type, however. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35]
T.1.5 - Damage prevention, phase ability, phase cost, and untap cost spells and abilities are played using the rules for instants. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]
T.1.6 - Interrupts may only be played during the interrupt part of another spell or ability's life cycle (see Rule T.5).
T.1.7 - The ability of a permanent with an activation cost is played as an instant unless otherwise stated on the card, or otherwise implied by its function. For example, Llanowar Elves has an ability that says it is a Mana Source, and the ability of Soul Net is clearly a triggered ability (see Rule A.8). [Fifth Edition, Page 25]
T.1.8 - The ability of a land to generate mana is played as a mana source even if it does not say so on the card. [Fifth Edition, Page 6] This is an exception to Rule T.1.7.
T.1.9 - An "event" is an atomic action in the game. It can also be defined as an uninteruptable timing step. Announcing a spell or ability, declaring attackers or blockers, and the resolution of a spell or ability are events (although a spell or ability's resolution may include multiple events, see Rule T.7.1). [bethmo 06/10/98]
T.1.Ruling.1 - The timing rules do not distinguish between spells and abilities. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.1.Ruling.2 - Many players really want to know about the "speed" of a spell or ability. The truth is that "speed" isn't a very important concept in Magic. The type of a spell/ability really just determines when it can be played rather than how "fast" it is. Artifacts (and artifact creatures), summonings, sorceries, and enchantments are _not_ slower to resolve than instants. The only difference is when they can be announced. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Note - Also see Fast Effect, Rule G.18.
Note - Also see Mana Sources, Rule T.12.
Note - Also see Triggered Abilities, Rule A.8.
Note - Also see Replacement Abilities, Rule A.7.
Note - Also see Lands, Rule K.17.
T.2 - Types of Effects
T.2.1 - The effects of a spell or ability come in several types. These are: continuous, one-shot, duration, and scheduled. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.2 - Spells and abilities with a "one-shot" effect are typically announced and simply take an action when they resolve. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.3 - The effects of a "one-shot" effect are permanent unless otherwise stated on the card (which usually means the effect is actually a duration effect). [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95] Many older cards have errata to deal with this change, so check the errata if something seems out of place.
T.2.4 - A continuous effect typically results from the continuous ability (see Rule A.4) of a permanent in play. Continuous effects are always being applied. See Rule T.14 for details on what order to apply them.
T.2.5 - Duration effects are usually created during the resolution of an announced spell or ability. They say they last "until <-some condition->" or "as long as <-some condition->" is met. Usually, this condition is a time such as "until end of turn", but the condition can be more complicated, such as "as long as the creature has at least one enchantment on it".
T.2.6 - During the duration of a duration effect, the effect is applied just as if it were a continuous effect. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.7 - If the duration of a duration effect is only until a certain condition happens and that condition is met before the ability generating the effect resolves, the effect fails to happen in the first place. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] For example, if you take control of a creature with Seasinger, and the Seasinger is untapped before the ability resolves, the ability fails to do anything and you never get control of the creature.
T.2.8 - A duration effect which lasts "until time T" ends right before that time starts, and right before handling things that happen at that time. So, if something lasts "until your next upkeep", it ends right before handing "at beginning of upkeep" effects. And if something lasts "until end of upkeep", it ends right before processing "at end of upkeep" effects. [Aahz 01/30/97]
T.2.9 - Scheduled effects are usually created during the resolution of an announced spell or ability. They say they will "<-do something-> at <-some time->". For example, "destroy this creature at end of turn" or "draw a card at the beginning of your next turn". Scheduled effects are played in a Series (see Rule T.9) at the appropriate time along with any phase abilities (see Rule A.5) played at that time. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.10 - All effects on a permanent end when the permanent leaves play. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]
T.2.Ruling.1 - The timing rules do result in some abilities or effects of spells and abilities being dealt with prior to others. Roughly speaking, the hierarchy is: a) Continuous effects are applied at all times. b) Playing a mana source (see Rule T.12), c) Replacement abilities, d) Rules Effects (see Rule T.13) are dealt with next. e) Triggered spells/abilities (see Rule A.8) are dealt with whenever they need to be. f) Announcing any other spell or ability is last. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.Ruling.2 - A continuous effect may modify how a permanent enters play. For example, Kismet will make land cards enter play in a tapped state. They do not enter play and tap afterwards. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97]
T.2.Ruling.3 - A continuous effect affects permanents as soon as they enter play. For example, if Blood Moon is in play and a non-basic land is played, the land enters play as its original land type but is changed to a Mountain immediately. If the permanent has any "comes into play" triggered abilities (see Rule E.3) on it, or if any abilities trigger on the original land type entering play, those abilities still trigger. [D'Angelo 10/03/96]
T.2.Ruling.4 - A duration effect lasts its full duration even if the source of the effect leaves play or temporarily becomes unapplicable to the effect. [Fifth Edition, Page 38] For example, if Giant Growth is cast on an artifact creature, which then stops being a creature for a while, the +3/+3 will still be there if it becomes a creature before the end of turn when the duration effect ends.
T.2.Ruling.5 - A duration or scheduled effect which waits until the "next upkeep" (or some similar relative time) will happen on the next applicable time. So, if phases or turns are skipped, the effect will keep waiting until the appropriate time happens. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]
T.2.Ruling.6 - A scheduled effect happens at the time specified even if the source of the effect left play or the original conditions that set up the effect no longer apply. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
T.2.Ruling.7 - A scheduled effect will do what it can at the specified time even if the effect would be meaningless on the target at that time. Meaningless effects simply do nothing. For example, you cannot give damage to or change the power/toughness of a non-creature. You may however, give a +1/+1 counter to a non-creature. Counters are always meaningful even if their effects are not. [D'Angelo 10/03/96]
T.2.Ruling.8 - Because of Rule T.2.10, a "do this at end of turn" can be avoided if the affected permanent leaves play by phasing out (see Rule G.30.4). [Aahz 10/04/96]
T.2.Ruling.9 - Cards which say an effect is "permanent" merely mean that the effect does not wear off. This is pretty much redundant since an effect is permanent unless otherwise stated anyway. But, it is important to remember that the word "permanent" does _not_ mean that the effect cannot be overridden. The effect can still be overridden. [D'Angelo 10/20/97]
Note - The term "immediately" is often used to describe how continuous effects take effect, because nothing is faster than these kinds of effects.
T.3 - Life Cycle of Spells and Abilities
T.3.1 - The life cycle for a spell or ability can be charted out like this: 1. Announcement -- Costs are paid. Targets are chosen. Choices are made. 2. Interrupt Period -- A chance is given to use interrupts to counter or modify the spell or ability. Mana sources do not have this step. 3. Waiting for resolution -- When a spell or ability gets to this stage, it is considered successfully "played", "cast" or "activated". It is placed in a batch. If it is being played in a Series (see Rule T.9), the spell or ability cannot be responded to. Mana sources do not have this step. 4. Resolution -- Check targets at this time. If a spell or ability's targets are valid, then its effects take place, otherwise it "fizzles". If in a batch, resolve in last-in-first-out manner.
T.4 - Step 1: Announcing a Spell or Ability
T.4.1 - This is also called "playing" a spell or ability.
T.4.2 - When announcing a spell or ability, all costs (see Rule G.7 and Rule K.21) are paid, all targets are selected (see Rule G.41), and any other decisions about how the spell or ability is being played are made.
T.4.3 - You cannot start this step unless you have all the costs and appropriate legal targets or choices. [Fifth Edition, Page 17]
T.4.4 - During the announcement, the spell being cast is not considered part of your hand for purposes of choices made during announcement. [Fifth Edition, Page 15] It is considered part of your hand for other reasons. For example, if you announce Infernal Harvest with no other cards in your hand, the swamps return to your hand at the same time the Infernal Harvest leaves your hand. There is no time when you have zero cards in your hand. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]
T.4.5 - A spell goes into "limbo" (see Rule Z.6) when it is announced and it is not considered to be in play or in the graveyard until it resolves. [Mirage, Page 60]
T.4.6 - Decisions which require looking at any player's hand, looking in a player's library, and counting or otherwise comparing cards in play are not made at this time. These things are considered as "hidden information" and so these decisions wait until resolution. [Aahz 09/09/97] Added your own hand to the list. [DeLaney 03/30/99]
T.4.7 - Counting of cards can happen during this step if it affects whether or not the spell or ability can be announced. [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]
T.4.8 - Decisions which are made that affect neither how it is announced or how it resolves are always delayed. For example, what to do about Mind Bomb damage or how many cards to draw during the upkeep following Arcane Denial being used. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 26]
T.4.9 - Targets and other choices selected by the opponent are also made during this step. But they are made after the current player makes any of their choices. [WotC Rules Team 06/27/96]
T.4.10 - All characteristics of the source of an ability are "locked in" at this time. [Fifth Edition, Page 17]
T.4.11 - Any abilities that trigger (see Rule A.8) during this step are saved up and handled at the beginning of the next step (see Rule T.5.1). [Aahz 01/12/95]
T.4.12 - Destroying or modifying the source of a spell or ability after it is announced will never cause the spell or ability to fail or change in any way. [Fifth Edition, Page 17]
T.4.Ruling.1 - Random choices are not made on announcement unless they are part of the cost. [D'Angelo 10/03/96]
T.4.Ruling.2 - Everything that happens during this step is considered to be simultaneous. [Mirage, Page 30] If this gets confusing, consider it as if the state of the game were saved just as the step starts and that's what you are playing against. This means, for example, you can target the card you are sacrificing to pay the cost of an ability.
T.4.Ruling.3 - This step is atomic. Not even mana sources may be used during the step. This means you must draw any mana you need prior to starting the announcement.
T.4.Ruling.4 - If the permanent is also the target of its own ability. The characteristics of itself as a target are checked on resolution as with any other spell or ability. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98]
T.4.Ruling.5 - To "play a card" is to either "announce" a spell or to put a land into play using the main phase special action (see Rule P.8.3). To "play an ability" is to "announce" the ability. [D'Angelo 01/18/99]
Note - If more than one target is to be selected at the same time, the same target may not be selected more than once. See Rule G.41.2.
Note - A permanent cannot be acted upon as a permanent until it is successfully resolved. This means that the permanent will have its full effect before you can do anything to it.
T.5 - Step 2: Interrupt Period
T.5.1 - At the beginning of this step, any abilities that triggered (see Rule A.8) during the announcement, or which trigger on a spell or ability be "played" (or "cast" or "activated") are dealt with in a Series (see Rule T.9).
T.5.2 - During this step, a spell is considered "being cast". The term "being played" applies to both spells and abilities. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
T.5.2 - During this step, any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of interrupts may be announced which target this spell or ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
T.5.3 - For any Batches (see Rule T.8) announced during this step, the active player is the controller of the current spell or ability instead of being the player whose turn it is. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
T.5.4 - If a spell or ability is Countered (see Rule G.8) during this step, it does not proceed to the next step and is not considered "successfully played" or "successfully cast". [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
Note - See Rule K.16 for information on Interrupts.
Note - Interrupts follow the standard life cycle steps, so they can themselves be interrupted.
T.6 - Step 3: Waiting for Resolution
T.6.1 - At the beginning of this step, any abilities which trigger (see Rule A.8) on a spell or ability being "successfully played" or "successfully cast" are dealt with in a Series (see Rule T.9). [Fifth Edition, Page 43]
T.6.2 - If this is a Batch (see Rule T.8), then the spell or ability is placed into the current batch and can be responded to as appropriate. Interrupts can be used to respond to interrupts, and instants can be used in response to other kinds of batches. If there are no responses, proceed to the next step. Adding something to an existing batch is called "responding to" a previous spell or ability.
T.6.3 - If this is a Series (see Rule T.9), then nothing else happens in this step. Proceed to the next step.
T.6.4 - Mana sources do not even stop in this step to handle the triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) for becoming "successfully cast". Those happen along with the play and resolution triggers after the resolution is complete.
T.7 - Step 4: Resolution
T.7.1 - This step can be charted out as follows: 1. Recheck targeting conditions. 2. For each part (called an "event", see Rule T.1.9) of the spell or ability's resolution text (events/parts are separated by the word "then" in the text), do the following. a. Chance for replacement spells and abilities (see Rule A.7). These happen in a Series (see Rule T.9). b. Resolve the event/part of spell resolution. If this is the last event and this is a spell which is to become a permanent, put the card into play. If this is the last event and this is a spell which is not to become a permanent, put this card into the graveyard. c. Deal with Rule Effects (see Rule T.13). These all happen simultaneously. Mana sources and replacement abilities (see Rule A.7) can be used before resolving these. d. Deal with triggered abilities (see Rule A.8). These happen in a Series (see Rule T.9). e. Deal with Damage Prevention from the resolution. See Rule T.10. Note that this does not happen if already in a Damage Prevention step (see Rule T.10.9).
T.7.2 - At the start of this step the spell or ability rechecks any targeting conditions it has. If it has any targets and all the targets are illegal, the spell or ability fizzles (see Rule G.19) and does nothing, not even its untargeted portions (and if it was to become a permanent, it is put into the graveyard instead). If it has no targets or at least one target is legal, the effect proceeds to happen normally but does nothing with regards to any targets which are illegal.
T.7.3 - Between each event/part, you deal with any triggered effects and damage caused by that event/part, then mana sources and replacement abilities can be used prior to the next event/part (if any). [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97] [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 34]
T.7.4 - If the resolution includes some condition under which the effect will end, and that condition is met on resolution, then the effect does not happen at all. These spells and abilities are usually written using "as long as" in the text. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] For example, Seasinger gives you control of a creature "as long as Seasinger is tapped". If the Seasinger is not tapped upon resolution, then the control gain fails to happen.
T.7.5 - Spells and abilities always resolve as completely as possible. A spell or ability that says "Do one thing. Do another" or one that says "Do one thing and do another" will do both effects even if one effect fails. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 22] This rule is limited by Rule T.7.2.
T.7.6 - If the spell or ability checks any aspect of a permanent in play (including the source), it does so during resolution. These values are looked up as needed (see Rule K.4.5). For example, when you use the ability of Prodigal Sorcerer, it puts "Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage to target creature or player" into the batch. On resolution, the color of the Prodigal Sorcerer is looked up to determine the color of the damage that is done. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98] This is a big REVERSAL. Characteristics of the source used to not be looked up again.
T.7.7 - A spell or ability has its own characteristics (see Rule K.4.4), and anything which checks the characteristics of the ability will not recheck the permanent. Very little checks the ability. Most things check the source, so this won't matter very often. [D'Angelo 10/22/98] Note that the check for valid targeting from Protection from Color is done by checking the color of the ability, not the source. [DeLaney 11/14/98]
T.7.Ruling.1 - The validity of the target is checked right at the beginning of this step and is not checked again. If a target is removed or made invalid after the start of resolution, then resolution continues anyway. [Aahz 08/04/97]
T.7.Ruling.2 - An event/part in a spell or ability's resolution may include multiple instructions which are to be done in order. [Aahz 08/05/97]
T.7.Ruling.3 - If a resolution includes repetition, each repetition is only a separate event/part if the word "then" shows up. Otherwise, they all happen in one event/part. [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 34]
T.7.Ruling.4 - Continuous abilities (see Rule A.4) and triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) are checked after each part/event of the resolution. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 34] For example, a Sea Serpent will trigger a "bury itself" ability if at the end of a part/event in the resolution you had no islands, and this effect will happen even if you would get some islands before the end of the complete resolution.
Note - See the targeting (Rule G.41) section for more information.
Note - Once resolution of a Batch (see Rule T.8) starts, no additional spells or abilities may be announced (and added to that Batch) until all spells and abilities in the batch have been resolved. See Rule T.8.8.
Note - Damage from an event/part is dealt with in a separate damage prevention step (see Rule T.10) from damage due to triggered abilities (see Rule A.8). [Aahz 08/25/97]
Note - The Series (see Rule T.9) for replacement abilities (see Rule A.7) and the Series for triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) allow mana sources to be used at these times. [Aahz 08/04/97]
T.8 - Batch
T.8.1 - The timing for a batch looks like this: [Fifth Edition, Page 25] 1. The active player may announce a spell or ability legal at this time: a. Chance for mana sources by active player. b. The active player may play spell or ability (through life cycle steps 1 and 2) and add it to the batch. Not playing something is called "yielding priority". c. Goto 1 if something is announced in 'b'. 2. If the active player yeilds priority, the other player may announce a spell or ability legal at this time: a. Chance for mana sources by other player. b. The other player may play spell or ability (through life cycle steps 1 and 2) and add it to the batch. Not playing something is called "yielding priority". c. Goto 1 if something is announced in 'b'. 3. Once both players yields priority, if there are any spells or abilities in the batch, start resolving the batch. If there are no spells or abilities in the batch, end the current phase (or other appropriate time interval).
T.8.2 - The active player is the player whose turn it is, except during batches of interrupts (see Rule T.5.3), when it is the player whose spell is being interrupted.
T.8.3 - When there is currently nothing in the batch, the game is said to be in a "neutral state". [Fifth Edition, Page 41]
T.8.4 - For non-interrupt batches, either player may play instants in the batch. In addition, during the main phase the player whose turn it is may start a batch with a Sorcery, Artifact, Artifact Creature, Enchantment, or Summoning.
T.8.5 - For interrupt batches, only interrupts may be played by either player.
T.8.6 - Adding something to an existing Batch is called "responding" to a spell or ability.
T.8.7 - Batches resolve in last-to-first order. This means the last played spell or ability actually resolves (see Rule T.7) first. Then the next to last, and so on. [Fifth Edition, Page 41] This can result in things being different than you expect sometimes, but it works to allow the responding player to get an advantage.
T.8.8 - While a Batch is resolving, neither player may play any new spells or abilities into the batch. They must wait for the complete resolution of the batch, then they may start another batch if desired. [Fifth Edition, Page 41] Note that triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) and other things may be played as appropriate. See Rule T.7.
T.8.Ruling.1 - Either player can end up starting a batch, but the active player always has priority.
Note - A player cannot "yield priority" (meaning skipping the chance to play something in a batch) if they have any mandatory abilities to deal with in that phase. See Rule A.5 for phase abilities and Rule A.6 for phase costs.
T.9 - Series
T.9.1 - The timing for a Series looks like this: 1. The active player plays any number of the appropriate spells or abilities. a. Chance for mana sources by active player. b. The active player may play and resolve a spell or ability with no chance to respond. c. If played something in 'b', goto 1. 2. The other player plays any number of the appropriate spells or abilities. a. Chance for mana sources by other player. b. The other player may play and resolve a spell or ability with no chance to respond. c. If played something in 'b', goto 2.
T.9.2 - Exactly what spells or abilities are legal in a Series is defined by the timing step which initiates the Series.
T.9.3 - Any specific spell or ability may be played only once in a given Series. [Fifth Edition, Page 40] The time for interrupts and the time for additional Series during the playing of a spell or ability in the Series, is not considered as part of the Series for this rule. [Aahz 09/18/97]
T.9.4 - A given ability may be played only once during any given series. If the ability is countered, you cannot use that same ability again for that same series, but you can use other abilities which do the same thing. For example, if a Clay Statue's built-in regeneration is Rusted, you cannot use its built in ability again, but you can use Death Ward. [Aahz 07/03/97]
T.9.5 - When in a Series of replacement abilities (see Rule A.7), an ability may alter the upcoming effect. If this happens, the current Series is ended and a new one is started. [Aahz 09/18/97] This gives both players a chance at the effect again and allows a given spell or ability to be used again.
T.9.6 - During Series in which begin/end of phase abilities (see Rule A.3) are being dealt with, if any new abilities of the appropriate type which are introduced are added to the current Series, so they have to be dealt with as well. This interacts with Rule T.9.1, in that once the active player's turn is done, you do not go back. This means that once you start dealing with the other player, anything added to the active player is simply ignored. [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]
T.9.Ruling.1 - Once the active player is done with a Series, you never go back to that active player for this Series, even if new things are added. [Fifth Edition, Page 40]
Note - See Rule G.21 for information on infinite loops.
T.10 - Damage Prevention Step
T.10.1 - The Damage Prevention Step can be charted out like this: [Fifth Edition, Page 50] 0. Damage Assignment - Right before the damage prevention step, damage is "assigned". Any choices about how the damage is assigned are made first, then apply replacement effects (such as Furnace of Rath) that modify the assignment. 1. Beginning of Damage Prevention - Play all abilities which either trigger on damage being "assigned", or which automatically prevent damage. Play these as a Series (see Rule T.9). 2. Main Part of Damage Prevention - Play any number of Batches (see Rule T.8) of spells and abilities which either prevent or redirect damage. 3. End of Damage Prevention - Play all abilities which automatically redirect damage or which say they are played at the end of damage prevention. Play these as a Series (see Rule T.9). 4. Damage is Successfully Dealt - Play all abilities which trigger on damage being "dealt". Play these as a Series (see Rule T.9). 5. Remove Dead Creatures a. Play any Regeneration (see Rule G.32) spells and abilities on creatures with lethal damage. Play these in a Series (see Rule T.9). b. Destroy any creature with lethal damage (see Rule K.12.4), and damaged players lose 1 life for each point of damage done to them. This is all done simultaneously. 6. Play all abilities which trigger on creatures being destroyed. Play these as a Series (see Rule T.9).
T.10.2 - A damage prevention step only happens if damage is assigned to something by a spell or ability resolving, or by combat. [Fifth Edition, Page 50]
T.10.3 - Only spells and abilities which prevent or redirect damage may be played during the main part of damage prevention. [Fifth Edition, Page 52] Also mana sources and interrupts to any legal spells. [D'Angelo 08/04/98]
T.10.4 - If multiple creatures and/or players are damaged at one time, they are all handled in one damage prevention step. [Fifth Edition, Page 50]
T.10.5 - If a single creature or player is damaged multiple times by a single source during the resolution of a spell or ability (or part thereof if it has multiple parts), then treat it as if the spell or ability damaged the player only once for the sum of the damage dealt. [Fifth Edition, Page 50]
T.10.6 - Damage redirected during step 3 is not considered successfully "dealt" during this damage prevention step. See Rule T.10.11. [Fifth Edition, Page 51]
T.10.7 - If the permanent is no longer a creature at the start of damage prevention, the damage is never assigned and is just ignored. [Aahz 11/08/96]
T.10.8 - If the permanent is no longer a creature at the end of damage prevention, the damage still does become successfully dealt, and effects due to damage will still happen if they make sense, but the target is considered to have zero power and toughness for any abilities that care about such. [Aahz 11/08/96] For example, El-Hajjaj will deal give you zero life since the toughness is zero. But Spirit Link still works since it does not care about the toughness of the thing it damages.
T.10.9 - New damage created during steps 1 and 2 is added to the current damage prevention step. [Fifth Edition, Page 51] This means that any spells or abilities during the damage prevention step do not get their own damage prevention step.
T.10.10 - If any new damage is assigned during steps 1 and 2, play all abilities which would be played at the Beginning of Damage Prevention upon the new damage. Play these as a Series (see Rule T.9). [Fifth Edition, Page 52]
T.10.11 - Damage created during step 3, 4, 5 or 6 is collected and handled in a new Damage Prevention step which immediately follows step 6. [bethmo 03/31/98]
T.10.12 - If an effect deals damage but gives a way to prevent that damage, the prevention is played during Damage Prevention and not during the resolution of the effect. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97] For example, Mind Bomb's discard to prevent damage is playable during the Damage Prevention following its resolution.
T.10.13 - If a spell or ability enables you to divide damage among several creatures and/or players, divide the damage first before starting any effects which happen when damage is assigned. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/98]
T.10.Ruling.1 - A damage prevention step happens even if there is no chance of preventing the damage.
T.10.Ruling.2 - Spells and abilities which do not prevent or redirect damage may not be used because of Rule T.10.3. This means you cannot use Giant Growth, Unsummon, or other tricks to save a creature at this time.
T.10.Ruling.3 - Destroying or burying a permanent does not cause a damage prevention step.
T.10.Ruling.4 - Reducing a creature's toughness to where it has "lethal damage" (see Rule K.12.4), does not cause a damage prevention step.
T.10.Ruling.5 - Tapping a blocking creature at this time to use a damage prevention ability is legal and will not undo the damage the blocker already did. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 37]
T.10.Ruling.6 - Protection from Color (see Rule A.24) is considered an automatic damage prevention ability.
T.10.Ruling.7 - Veteran Bodyguard, Martyrs of Korlis, and Soul Echo have automatic damage redirection abilities.
T.10.Ruling.8 - Ali from Cairo and Sustaining Spirit have abilities played at the end of damage prevention.
T.10.Ruling.9 - Hypnotic Specter and Spirit Link have abilities that trigger on damage being successfully "dealt".
T.10.Ruling.10 - Urza's Saga uses a different set of notations than previous sets did. Previously, damage was "assigned" at the start of damage prevention and was "dealt" if not prevented. Cards now use "dealt" for the assignment and "successfully dealt" if not prevented. This file uses the older notation and the affected Urza's Saga cards have notes on them for how to read them that way. [D'Angelo 10/12/98]
T.10.Ruling.11 - Continuous replacement abilities (see Rule A.7.5) which apply to damage being assigned are applied before any abilities that trigger on damage being assigned. [D'Angelo 11/03/98] For example, Furnace of Rath.
T.10.Ruling.12 - If a continuous replacement ability (see Rule A.7.5) affects damage to multiple places, you process its effect on every place at one time. Thus, you cannot order the replacements differently for one place over another. [bethmo 11/24/98]
T.10.Ruling.13 - Because creatures are destroyed and you lose life due to damage at the same time (see Rule T.10.1, step 5b), an Ali from Cairo can help you at the same time it is being destroyed, and a Worship can help you at the same time your last creature is being destroyed. [bethmo 11/24/98]
T.10.Ruling.14 - Creatures are not checked for lethal damage until sub-step 5. Sub-step 5a is the chance to use replacement abilities on the creature's death and 5b is the actual death. [bethmo 12/21/98]
T.10.Ruling.15 - Sub-steps 4, 5, and 6 are all done during the damage prevention step, even though they are listed after a step that is named "end of damage prevention". [D'Angelo 12/22/98]
Note - Loss of life is not damage and cannot be prevented or redirected. See Rule G.24.
T.11 - Interrupts
T.11.1 - Interrupts always target a spell or ability which is currently "being played" or "being cast". [Fifth Edition, Page 42] See Rule T.5 for when this is true.
T.11.2 - Interrupts follow the standard life cycle (see Rule T.3), so they can be interrupted.
T.11.3 - An interrupt which modifies the color, target, or wording of a spell can change how the spell will resolve.
T.11.4 - An interrupt fizzles (see Rule G.19) if the spell or ability it is targeting has been countered (see Rule G.8) before it resolves. [Fifth Edition, Page 42]
Note - Changing or destroying the source of an ability after it is announced does not alter or stop the ability. See Rule T.4.12.
Note - All interrupts which can target a permanent say they are played as instants when doing so.
T.12 - Mana Sources
T.12.1 - Mana source spells and abilities can be played by a player whenever they have priority to announce something. [Aahz 01/17/97] Basically, if there is a chance you might need mana at a given time, the rules allow you to use mana sources at that time.
T.12.2 - It is not possible to play mana source spells and abilities during the middle of any other game action. The only exception is that some spells and abilities use the word "then" in their card text to separate its resolution into multiple parts. When this happens, mana sources may be used between those parts.
T.12.3 - Mana sources do not go through the normal spell life cycle. They resolve immediately after they are announced. Their timing looks like this: [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97] 1. Announcement -- Costs are paid. Targets are chosen. Choices are made. See Rule T.4 for details. 2. Resolution -- Check targets at this time. If a spell or ability's targets are valid, then its effects take place, otherwise it "fizzles". See Rule T.7 for details on how resolution works.
T.12.4 - This timing results in all the triggered abilities (see Rule A.8) from the spell/ability played, being "successfully cast/played", and resolving being played in the same Series (see Rule T.9). [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]
T.12.5 - No spell, ability, or effect can prevent a mana source spell or ability from being played. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97] Note that normal game rules such as summoning sickness (see Rule G.39) and phase costs (see Rule A.6) can prevent them, however. [Aahz 10/09/97]
T.12.Ruling.1 - The cost of a mana source spell/ability can be modified. [Aahz 10/07/97]
T.12.Ruling.2 - Triggered abilities which try to counter a spell, such as Nether Void, will fizzle when they try to counter a mana source, since the mana source is no longer "being cast". This is because of Rule T.12.4. [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]
Note - Tapping a land for mana is always done as a mana source even if it does not say so on the land. See Rule K.17.2.
Note - Lands themselves are not considered mana sources. See Rule K.17.Ruling.2.
Note - There are only a few spells of type Mana Source, including Burnt Offering, Culling the Weak, Dark Ritual, Sacrifice, and Songs of the Damned.
T.13 - Rule Effects
T.13.1 - Some rules in the game are played much as if they were triggered abilities. These are called Rule Effects. For example, if a duplicate Legend enters play, the new one is buried (See Rule K.19.1). [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]
T.13.2 - Rule effects are applied after continuous effects but before dealing with triggered abilities. They are checked at all times when triggered abilities can happen. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35]
T.13.3 - The burial of enchantments because their targets are not valid is considered a Rule Effect. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]
T.13.4 - Marking a creature as dying due to lethal damage is a Rule Effect. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35]
T.13.5 - All Rule Effects that happen because of a particular action or part/event are dealt with simultaneously. [Aahz 08/10/97]
T.13.Ruling.1 - Rule Effects do not check their conditions during the middle of resolution of a spell or ability. They only check when triggered abilities are about to start. See Rule T.13.2. For example, if an effect makes someone discard 7 cards and draw 7 cards in that order in one part/event of a resolution, the rule trigger will not mark a Maro card as dying since you have enough cards at the end of the part of the resolution. But if the discard and draw are in different parts/events of the resolution (separated by the word "then"), Maro could die between the two parts/events of the resolution.
T.13.Ruling.2 - Rule Effects are not controlled by any player. [WotC Rules Team 03/31/98]
T.13.Ruling.3 - They are played just after cards phase in (see Rule G.30). [D'Angelo 05/28/98]
T.13.Ruling.4 - There is a chance to use mana sources and replacement abilities (see Rule A.7) prior to resolving Rule Effects. [D'Angelo 07/16/98]
T.14 - Order to Apply Effects
T.14.1 - The simple rule of effects is that effects are applied in the order they enter play. [Fifth Edition, Page 35] This means that a more recent effect may override an older one. For example, if a creature has Earthbind on it and then Flight is played on it, the creature will be Flying because Flight is the newer effect.
T.14.2 - In some cases, the simple rule isn't enough. The more complete rule is that if an effect depends on checking a characteristic, you first must evaluate anything which changes that characteristic, unless doing so forms a loop of effects. When effects of any kind conflict or when dependencies form a loop, the order in which the abilities were played decides the order in which their effects are applied. [WotC Rules Team 02/01/98] For example, Kormus Bell turns all Swamps into creatures, even lands that become Swamps after it is played. Crusade gives +1/+1 to all white creatures, even those that become white or creatures after Crusade is played. Humility turns all creatures into 1/1 creatures with no abilities even if they become creatures after Humility is played.
T.14.3 - If an effect checks and changes the same characteristic, it is not considered to be depending on that characteristic for use in Rule T.14.2. [D'Angelo 02/03/98] For example, Conversion checks the type of a land to see if it is a Mountain and then changes the type to Plains. Conversion is ordered as a change effect, so a newer Phantasmal Terrain effect will be able to change a land into a Mountain without being changed by Conversion.
T.14.4 - For purposes of these rules, each permanent considers its built-in abilities to be the oldest effect upon itself. [Fifth Edition, Page 36] This means that if an enchantment says that all creatures lose Flying, a Flying creature that was in play before, or enters play after this enchantment entered play, will still lose Flying.
T.14.5 - Changing the base power/toughness or base abilities of a card will not change the "when it entered play" time for that cards effects. [D'Angelo 11/07/96] For example, a Keldon Warlord's power/toughness are recalculated, but are still considered to be built in.
T.14.6 - Changing a permanent's text with Sleight of Mind or Magical Hack does not change the base card, but it is ordered before other effects due to Rule T.14.2.
T.14.Ruling.1 - The rules for the order to apply effects apply to spells, abilities, enchantments, and duration effects equally. All of these are simply effects and are considered all together. [bethmo 06/29/94]
T.14.Ruling.2 - If the source of an effect is removed or changed, re-apply the effects using the rules to discover the new outcome. If the removed effect was one that changed a characteristic, side-effects may result. [bethmo 06/29/94] For example, if you cast a Conversion enchantment to change all Mountains into Plains and then used Magical Hack on a second Conversion enchantment to turn all Mountains into Forests, the first one would be applied and turn them all into Plains. The second one would find no Mountains in play, so it would do nothing. Later, if the first one were removed, the second one would immediately discover the Mountains and convert them to Forests.
T.14.Ruling.3 - When a card phases in (see Rule G.30), its effect is considered to be a new one entering play. [Aahz 11/08/96]
T.14.Ruling.4 - A permanent with a built-in conditional ability is still considered to have that ability as a base ability. For example, if it had "As long as this card is untapped, it gains Flying", it would act as if Flying were in its base abilities while it was untapped and as if it were not when it was tapped. [Aahz 08/10/97]
T.14.Ruling.5 - If the permanent has a conditional ability that affects other cards (possibly including itself), the effect of ability is considered to enter play when the permanent does. [Aahz 08/10/97] For example, if it said "All untapped creatures gain Flying", then that ability would be applied using the normal order-to-apply-effects rule even when applying to itself.
T.15 - Play As A...
T.15.1 - When a spell says "Play this as a <-spell type->", then the spell can be played at any time the <-spell type-> can be played, but the spell is still considered to be its actual type. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] For example, Hydroblast is an Interrupt which is played as an instant when targeting a permanent in play. When Hydroblast is targeting a permanent, it can be played any time Instants can be played, but it is considered to be a spell of type Interrupt even when cast this way.
T.15.2 - When an ability says "Play this ability as a <-spell type->", then the ability actually is of that type in all ways. It affects when the ability may be announced, and the type of the ability. [WotC Rules Team 08/05/97] [Duelist Magazine #20, Page 35] For example, when Amulet of Unmaking's ability is played, it is a sorcery ability in all ways. It is still an ability and not a spell, however.
T.15.Ruling.1 - "Play this as an instant" and "play this whenever you could play an instant" means the same thing. Don't read more into the wording. [Aahz 09/29/97]
Note - This is one of the few rules where spells and abilities are treated differently.
T.16 - Timing Conflicts
T.16.Ruling.1 - The timing rules are explicit about who can announce something and when they can announce it, but following all the rules strictly can be nearly impossible given the need to play a game smoothly and quickly. Thus, conflicts can happen.
T.16.Ruling.2 - "I'm done" always means "I'm done unless you do something else". If the player does something, then you continue as if you never said you were done. Anything legal at that time is still legal. [bethmo 1994] Be careful about the use of this phrase since it is often unclear if you are done with a batch of spells, done with the main phase or done with your turn.
T.16.Ruling.3 - If the current player skips on to a new phase when the opponent wanted to announce something, or a player announces multiple spells/abilities at one time without allowing a chance to make a legal response, or the opponent announces something when the current player was going to do so, then you should back up the game and continue from the point where the goof-up occurred. Players are not bound to follow the same set of actions they did after that time. You should stop the game as soon as possible by jumping in with a "Wait! I want to do something". Letting something pass without saying "Wait" is quiet agreement with what they did.
T.16.Ruling.4 - If the opponent announces something without first getting the current player to say (or otherwise indicate) they are not doing something, this is technically an illegal move and should be taken back. The most common way to deal with this, however, is for the current player to get the choice of saying that they want to do something and force the other player to take back their action, or to let the opponent's action stand and announce whether or not they want to respond. This is pretty much equivalent in the outcome to taking it back and then having the current player say "I'm not doing anything, go ahead and play that again." [D'Angelo 02/12/97]
T.16.Ruling.5 - You cannot make someone back up because you forgot to do something, even if it is something you "usually do". They may allow you to in friendly play if they want but they are not bound to do so, and are in fact not allowed to do so during tournaments.
Note - Strictly speaking you have to notify your opponent at every point what you are doing with things like "I'm announcing this spell, do you want to interrupt it", "I'm done with this Batch, do you want to add anything to it before it resolves", and "I'm done with the xxxx phase, do you want to do anything". This is very annoying and breaks up game play, but if you are having problems with a given player, fall back on this until you learn to deal with each other.
U - Unglued
U.1 - Humor
U.1.1 - Unglued was designed to be funny. Keep that in mind.
U.1.2 - It is very unlikely that you'll manage to get the NetReps or Customer Service to agree on some rulings for these cards. So, if there are two or more rulings from official people out there, use the one that you think will be funniest. In Arena, the Arena judge chooses. In friendly play, agree amongst yourselves, or toss a coin. [Barclay 08/13/98]
U.2 - Token Cards
U.2.1 - Some cards have a picture and no text. These are intended for use to represent token creatures for you so you don't have use coins, glass beads, kittens, pick-up trucks, or other handy objects. [QAS 09/09/98]
U.2.2 - When using one of these to represent a token creature, they count as tokens, not cards. [QAS 09/09/98]
U.3 - Other
U.3.1 - A teammate is a player who shares a victory condition with you. In other words, you both work together to win and win as a team. [QAS 09/09/98] Partnership and Emporer formats have teammates. Grand Melee and normal two-player games do not.
U.3.2 - When judging if a person performed a subjective task correctly, use your best judgement. An honest attempt which falls a little short should not be penalized. [QAS 09/09/98] Subjective tasks include rhyming, doing an action for Bureaucracy, complimenting an opponent, etc.
U.3.3 - Any random source with the same odds can replace a coin toss or die roll. [QAS 09/09/98] But the replacement still counts as its original type. For example, rolling a die to simulate a coin counts as a coin flip and not a die roll. [D'Angelo 09/09/98]
U.3.4 - You cannot target a player in a different game. [QAS 09/09/98]
U.3.5 - If you rip up or mark a card in a tournament because you are required to do so by a spell or ability, your deck is not made illegal. Instead, before the next game, you must bring your deck back up to 60 cards by borrowing from your sideboard (if your sideboard has any more cards and if your deck fell below 60). [QAS 09/09/98]
U.3.6 - If you are required to remove cards from your deck or sideboard for the duration of a match a tournament, your deck is not made illegal. Instead, before the next game, you must bring your deck back up to 60 cards by borrowing from your sideboard (if your sideboard has any more cards and if your deck fell below 60). [QAS 09/09/98]
U.3.Ruling.1 - You cannot use a coin with two heads (or tails) or a die which does not have 6 different values, as per Rule U.3.3. [D'Angelo 10/23/98]
Z - Zones of Play
Z.1 - Zones of Play
Z.1.1 - There are 8 zones in Magic. The zones are: Hand, Graveyard, Library, Territory (also called "In Play"), Out of Game, Phased Out, Ante, and Limbo. [Oracle 07/01/98]
Z.1.2 - Each player has their own version of each zone, with the exception of the Territory (also called "In Play") zone, which is shared by all players. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 55]
Z.1.3 - If a card (or token) moves from one zone to another, it forgets everything about what it was doing and any effects which were upon the card lose track of it. [Fifth Edition, Page 61] For example, a card in the graveyard does not know if it was ever in play or if it just got discarded to end up there. Rule Z.6.3 and Rule Z.8.3 outline two exceptions to this rule.
Z.1.4 - If more than one card is moved from one zone to another by a single effect, all those cards move simultaneously. If the new zone requires some sort of ordering (as with the Graveyard and Library), the controller of that zone decides in what order to place the cards. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 55]
Z.1.5 - If a card or token is sent to the Hand, Graveyard, Library, or Ante zone, it always goes to its owner's version of that zone. [Mirage, Page 61]
Z.1.Ruling.1 - If a permanent in play has an effect on it such as "return to owner's hand at end of turn", that effect will end as soon as the permanent leaves play. See Rule Z.1.3. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.1.Ruling.2 - An ability which triggers on a card (or token) moving from one zone to another can remember information about the card (or token) in the previous zone. [D'Angelo 02/03/98] See Rule A.8.7 and Rule A.8.8.
Z.1.Ruling.3 - An ability that triggers on something going from one zone to another is not resolved until after the something gets to its target zone. [Mirage, Page 61]
Z.2 - Ante
Z.2.1 - Magic can be played for "ante". This means that you are playing for the ownership of one (or more) of your opponent's cards. [Mirage, Page 55]
Z.2.2 - When playing for ante, after shuffling and cutting the decks prior to playing a game, the top card off each deck is put into the Ante. The winner of the game gets property ownership of these cards. [Mirage, Page 55]
Z.2.3 - Any card which refers to a player's ante, refers to all cards they currently have in the ante zone. [Mirage, Page 55]
Z.2.4 - Unless the game is specifically played with hidden ante, the ante cards can be examined by either player at any time. [Mirage, Page 55]
Note - Ante is not normally used in tournament environments.
Note - Ante is commonly used in limited play environments as a kind of forced trading, and as a reward for good play.
Note - Some places consider ante a form of gambling and so it is disallowed in those places.
Z.3 - Graveyard
Z.3.1 - The graveyard is where cards go when they are discarded from a player's hand or when they are destroyed, buried, or sacrificed while in play. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.3.2 - The graveyard is also called the discard pile. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.3.3 - The graveyard has an order to it. All cards that enter the graveyard are placed on top of it. [Mirage, Page 59] Because of this and Rule Z.1.4, if more than one card is to be placed in at a time, the owner of that graveyard decides the order the cards get stacked in.
Z.3.4 - Information about the graveyard is public. All players have the right to know what cards are in every player's graveyard and what order they are in. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.3.5 - Abilities of cards in the graveyard cannot be used and have no effect on the game unless the card specifically says they do. For example, the Nether Shadow has an ability which can be played while it is in the graveyard, but the White Knight does not have Protection from Black while in the graveyard. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.3.Ruling.1 - Any token sent to the graveyard is removed from the game just after they get there but immediately before anything else in the game can happen. See Rule K.25.6. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.3.Ruling.2 - Cards in the graveyard are just cards. They have no memory of whether they were ever in play or not, or of anything that may have happened to them when they were in play. This includes removal of any choices about the card, any alterations via spells like Magical Hack, any counters on the card, and so on. [Mirage, Page 59] See Rule Z.1.3.
Z.3.Ruling.3 - If something goes to the graveyard then comes back, it is considered a new card since it forgot its past when it went to the graveyard. [bethmo 05/03/94] See Rule Z.1.3.
Z.3.Ruling.4 - If a card talks about a "creature card in the graveyard", it is referring to any Summon card or Artifact Creature card. See Rule K.11.Ruling.1.
Z.3.Ruling.5 - Spells and abilities which allow you to select cards in your graveyard are usually targeted. [Aahz 06/18/95]
Note - Each player starts the game with an empty Graveyard.
Note - When a card is brought from the graveyard directly into play, see Rule G.31.
Z.4 - Hand
Z.4.1 - A player's hand is where they keep cards which they may cast or play. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.4.2 - The number of cards in a player's hand is public information. All players have the right to know this number. But they do not get to know what cards you hold (unless a spell or ability says otherwise). [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.4.3 - Spell cards being announced are considered to not be in your hand for purposes of target selection, sacrifices, and other things related to casting the spell. For all other reasons, such as for the power/toughness of Maro, the spell card is still in your hand until the spell announcement is complete. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]
Z.4.Ruling.1 - You always get to know what cards an opponent sees when they look at cards from your hand. [D'Angelo 02/10/97]
Z.4.Ruling.2 - You are not allowed to show cards in your hand to other players. [Aahz 03/04/97]
Note - Each player starts the game with 7 cards in their hand. See Rule P.1.5.
Z.5 - Library
Z.5.1 - Your library is where the cards in your deck sit until they are drawn. It is also called your "draw pile". [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.5.2 - The contents of a player's library are not public. No player (not even the owner of the library) may look at the cards therein unless instructed to do so by a spell or ability. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.5.3 - You do not need to show any other player what cards are going into or coming out of a Library unless the cards came from a publicly viewable place, in which case you may only hide the order in which you place the cards. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.5.4 - The number of cards in your library is public information and every player has the right to know the count. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.5.5 - The library has an order to it. All cards that are placed on the library are placed on top of it, and all cards taken from the library are taken from the top of it, unless otherwise specified. [D'Angelo 02/03/98] Because of this and Rule Z.1.4, if more than one card is to be placed on the library at one time, the owner of that library decides the order the cards get stacked in it. [D'Angelo 02/03/99]
Z.5.6 - If a spell or ability has you do something to more cards in your library than you currently have in your library, it affects all the remaining cards. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.5.7 - If a player is instructed to draw a card and their library is empty, that player loses the game. This happens at the next time Rule Effects (see Rule T.13) are checked, which is usually the end of the resolution of the current spell or ability. [Fifth Edition, Page 58]
Z.5.Ruling.1 - Spells and abilities which allow you to select cards in your library are not targeted. [Aahz 06/18/95]
Z.5.Ruling.2 - If a spell or ability has you choose one or more cards from your library, shuffle the rest of the library, and then put the chosen cards on top, the chosen cards are considered to be in your library during this entire process. The entire action is one step and not even mana sources can be used in between the choosing and putting back. [Aahz 03/17/97]
Note - You must start the game with at least 40 cards in your library before you draw your initial hand. See Rule P.1.2. Note that DCI tournament rules may require a larger deck size. See Rule D.13.5, Rule D.14.5, Rule D.15.4, Rule D.16.7, and Rule D.19.6.
Z.6 - Limbo
Z.6.1 - Limbo is the name of the place where spells and abilities which have been announced but have not yet been resolved are. [Mirage, Page 60]
Z.6.2 - A spell or ability leaves limbo only if it is countered or when it resolves. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.6.3 - Cards in this zone break one of the basic rules of zones (see Rule Z.1.3). They can leave this zone and carry editing effects with them. [bethmo 11/24/98]
Z.7 - Out of Game
Z.7.1 - This is where cards go when they are removed from the game. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.7.2 - Information about the out of game zone is public. All players have the right to know what cards are in every player's out of game area. [Mirage, Page 60] Specific cards may override this and specify that cards are moved into this zone face down. This is common for older cards which used to "set aside" cards. [Oracle 07/01/98]
Note - Also see Rule G.33 for rules on removing a permanent from the game.
Note - Older cards which said to "set aside" cards place those cards into this zone. [Oracle 07/01/98]
Z.8 - Phased Out
Z.8.1 - This is where cards are placed when they phase out (see Rule G.30.1). [Oracle 07/01/98]
Z.8.2 - Information about the Phased Out zone is public. All players have the right to know what cards are in every player's Phased Out area (unless otherwise noted). [Mirage, Page 60]
Z.8.3 - Cards in this zone break one of the basic rules of zones (see Rule Z.1.3). They can enter and leave this zone and carry changes with them, such as counters and enchantments. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.9 - Set Aside
Z.9.1 - The Set Aside zone was merged into the Out from Game. [Oracle 07/01/98]
Z.9.2 - All spells and abilities which said to "set aside" a card now remove the card from the game (usually temporarily).
Z.9.3 - It's common to put these card under or near the card in play which removed them, but these cards are not in play. [Mirage, Page 60]
Z.9.4 - Cards that are set aside may only be viewed if the spell or ability that puts them there makes them face-up. Most cards should have errata to make this clear. [D'Angelo 10/08/98]
Z.10 - Territory
Z.10.1 - The Territory is also known as your "in play" area. [Mirage, Page 59]
Z.10.2 - The Territory is where permanents (see Rule K.2) exist. [D'Angelo 02/03/98]
Z.10.Ruling.1 - Each player has their own territory, but all of the territories are considered to be in one zone. See Rule Z.1.2. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 55]
Note - Tokens cannot exist outside of this zone. See Rule K.25.6.
