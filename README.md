Dates in CR name files are slightly off:
they correspond to the date when CRs were uploaded, not when they began to apply.

## URLs

File `url.txt` contains each URL that points to the original and official CR file.
However, website `www.wizard.com` is done, meaning that every file that was uploaded there cannot be found anymore. Fortunately, you can use the Wayback Machine to find a copy of most of those files.
Some URLs are lost, such as URLs for following CRS:
* 2018-06-08
* 2018-04-27
* 2018-01-19
* 2017-09-29

## Very old CRs

They can be found on website `http://www.crystalkeep.com/magic/rules/index.html`
